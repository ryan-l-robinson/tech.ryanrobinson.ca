<p>I recently learned about a new framework for a fully HTML and CSS implementation of Microsoft’s Fluent Design system. This can make your life a lot easier when designing web apps that stick to that design. I haven’t tried it out yet – I’m hoping to get a full SharePoint Framework experiment together soon – but it looks very promising.</p>
