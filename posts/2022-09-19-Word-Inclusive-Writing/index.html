<p>I recently learned that Word has a lot of options for what kinds of prompts the spelling and grammar check will give you. One category of these options is inclusivity, helping you write in a way that better includes everyone. Many of these also conveniently double as being more concise, e.g. &quot;child&quot; instead of &quot;boy or girl&quot; or &quot;spouse&quot; instead of &quot;husband or wife.&quot;</p>
<p>To turn these on (using the latest Windows version of Word):</p>
<ol>
<li>Click on &quot;File&quot; from the main menu</li>
<li>Click on &quot;Options&quot; at the bottom</li>
<li>Click on the &quot;Proofing&quot; tab</li>
<li>Under &quot;When correcting spelling and grammar in Word,&quot; select the &quot;Settings&quot; button beside &quot;Writing Style&quot;</li>
<li>This will open a pane with a long list of options, including the inclusive writing tools. Check the box beside each option you want to turn on and apply your choices.</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="/assets/img/2022/09/word-inclusive-language.png" alt="&quot;Screenshot of the inclusive writing options&quot;"></p>
<p>The option categories are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Age bias</li>
<li>Cultural bias</li>
<li>Ethnic slurs</li>
<li>Gender bias</li>
<li>Gender-neutral pronouns</li>
<li>Gender-specific language</li>
<li>Racial bias</li>
<li>Sexual orientation bias</li>
<li>Socioeconomic bias</li>
</ol>
<p>If you want to be more inclusive in your writing, this is a helpful tool to turn on and have in your toolbox.</p>
