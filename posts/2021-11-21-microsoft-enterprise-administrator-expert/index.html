<p>Last week, I passed <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/exams/ms-101">the MS-101 exam</a>. This completed a goal I have had for a few years, earning me <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/m365-enterprise-administrator/">the Microsoft Enterprise Administrator Expert certification.</a></p>
<p>I first got into SharePoint about 6 years ago. It was before modern SharePoint, so not the most pleasant experience, but I still found myself fascinated by it. I decided I wanted to learn more about that space and pursue some certifications in it.</p>
<p>I began working toward the MCSE which would take 3 exams. I got the first one, the 70-346, in November 2018. When I got back that day and went to book the next one, Microsoft had announced changes to the certifications. My 70-346 was not going to expire but was effectively obsolete.</p>
<p>So I needed to start again, with the MS-100 that is roughly what the 70-346 was. I got that one in December 2019.</p>
<p>The job I was working at the time left me with no real free time, so it was slow but eventually I decided to book the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/exams/ms-700">MS-700 on Teams administration</a>. I booked that in November 2020 for March 2021, giving myself lots of study time. I booked the MS-101 for soon after.</p>
<p>But this was in the middle of the pandemic (so far). The testing centre remained closed. Multiple times in a row I got notified that it needed to be rescheduled. I eventually wrote and passed the MS-700 in September.</p>
<p>Then I wrote and passed the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/exams/sc-400">SC-400 on Microsoft Information Protection</a>. That one wasnâ€™t a big priority for me, but I got a free exam through an Ignite challenge and it helped me study for the MS-101.</p>
<p>And then I finally got the MS-101 last week. It was almost a year after initially booking it, and about 6 years since I first decided to get these certifications, so this was a huge sigh of relief.</p>
<p>I just earned another one through another Ignite challenge, so I may be looking at squeezing in one more late winter / early spring. Iâ€™m thinking <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/exams/pl-900">PL-900: Power Platform Fundamentals</a>, which is something I already know fairly well. But first, a bit of a break to focus on other things including wrapping up some of the 28 drafts I currently have sitting on this website to finish and publish ðŸ™‚</p>
