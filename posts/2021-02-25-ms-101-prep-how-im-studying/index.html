<p>Over the last few months, I’ve been working on preparing for <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/exams/ms-101">the MS-101 exam</a>. This exam covers a few topics around enterprise device management and security. I’ve mostly been studying with a few methods:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://www.measureup.com/ms-101-microsoft-365-mobility-and-security.html">official practice test from MeasureUp</a></li>
<li>Reading the learning paths from Microsoft</li>
<li>Reading <a href="https://www.packtpub.com/product/microsoft-365-mobility-and-security-exam-guide-ms-101/9781838984656">a prep booklet from Nate Chamberlain</a></li>
<li>Trying as much as I can in my personal tenant with license trials, or a dev tenant, but some things can be hard to test out without significant amounts of real data and users</li>
</ul>
<p>I’m adding another piece: writing about it. One of the best ways to learn something is to try to explain to somebody else in your own words. So with that, I’m starting a new series on what I’m learning as I study for the MS-101.</p>
