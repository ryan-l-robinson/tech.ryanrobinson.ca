# About Ryan and this Site

I’m Ryan Robinson. I’ve been working in technology for my adult life, especially websites, Microsoft 365, and CRM systems. I am now primarily focused on website development, particularly in Drupal. On this site I document some of the work I’ve done, whether within a full-time job, freelance work, volunteering, or as a personal side project. I hope you find some of it useful.

If you're interested in more from me beyond tech, see [ryanrobinson.ca](https://ryanrobinson.ca).

## Technical Education and Certifications

I completed a Bachelor of Computing Honours from Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario, Canada, with a specialization in Cognitive Science. More recently, I have obtained Microsoft 365 certifications:

## Freelance Work

I have previously completed freelance work under the name of Alliteration Applications. This started with some BlackBerry mobile applications but progressed to websites (mostly WordPress), email migrations, Microsoft 365 support, and occasional other bits and pieces of IT support.
I have phased out the use of that brand as my focus is on my full-time employment.

I am still open to occasional freelance work that fits within my schedule, but not actively seeking it out.
