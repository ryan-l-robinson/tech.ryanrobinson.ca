I’m Ryan Robinson. I’ve been working in technology for my adult (and some of my teen) life, especially websites, Microsoft 365, and CRM systems. I am now primarily focused on website development, particularly in Drupal. On this site I document some of the work I’ve done, whether within a full-time job, freelance work, volunteering, or as a personal side project. I hope you find it useful.

If you're interested in more from me beyond tech, see [ryanrobinson.ca](https://ryanrobinson.ca).

## Technical Education and Certifications

I completed a Bachelor of Computing Honours from [Queen's University](https://queensu.ca) in Kingston, Ontario, Canada, with a specialization in Cognitive Science.

I have also obtained some Microsoft 365 certifications:

### Microsoft 365 Certified: Enterprise Administrator Expert

## Freelance Work

I have previously completed freelance work under the name of Alliteration Applications. This started with some BlackBerry mobile applications but progressed to websites (mostly WordPress), email migrations, Microsoft 365 support, and occasional other bits and pieces of IT support.
I have phased out the use of that brand as my focus is on my full-time employment. I am still open to occasional freelance work that fits within my schedule, but not actively seeking it out.
