## Decisions

Here are some of the areas that I have considered. Some I have already made changes. Others I am considering. Others I wish I could but it really doesn't seem realistic.

Generally speaking, at this stage I have zero connection to Meta or to [X The Everything Including Child Sex Abuse Material App](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/01/x-blames-users-for-grok-generated-csam-no-fixes-announced/), a little for Amazon and Apple (mostly their video streaming services occasionally), but a lot with Microsoft and with Google.

### Email

I currently have an email with Microsoft. The good news is that my address is a custom domain, and I have the old Windows Live Domain offering from when it was free to get email with a custom domain (like Google also had). That means I could move the address somewhere else and nobody else should even notice. That part will always be non-negotiable to me: you have to control your address, even if you don't control the servers.

I have absolutely zero interest in hosting my own email. That is a massive can of worms to keep up with things like Gmail not marking you as spam, as well as ongoing costs to keep a server running with zero downtime or you start missing email. I used to have my email in a paid Microsoft 365 Business account and even that I decided was more hassle than it was worth compared to using the free one.

Proton then seems like the most viable other option, at $5 CAD per month for the Mail Plus plan. They're not Canadian hosted, but at least they're in the EU with much higher privacy standards and it isn't one of the tech giants. That is probably one switch I could make relatively easily on my own.

Proton also offers more intensive plans, with cloud storage, password manager, and VPN. The first two of those I'll also get into more below. VPN may be nice but I don't think I really need it often enough for that to be more than a nice bonus. I would consider those, but only if moving an entire family.

### Cloud Storage and Document Editing

I have a Microsoft 365 Family subscription, shared with some family.

In terms of document editing, LibreOffice would almost certainly handle everything I need: some simple writing and occasional slide presentation. I could drop using the Microsoft 365 desktop apps and replace it quite easily. I'm not fully confident that everybody else using the family plan would accept that, although shifting to LibreOffice might not really be that hard for them either. We're not talking about complex layout design requirements, just some occasional writing or presenting.

The main reason we pay for the Family plan, though, is the cloud storage. It was until recently $110 CAD a year for the Family plan that includes 6 TB total of storage; it's now jumped to $145. That 6TB is really 1TB per user, but [you can set up sharing so that the files are distributed across the accounts](/2021/onedrive-family-plan-loophole/). I have all our photos in OneDrive at full quality. I have a lot of photos with people in them in Google Photos as well, since that makes it easier to find photos by person for things like a digital photo frame or to add a photo to a contact on my phone's address book.

sync.com is Canadian and they offer 5TB for $336 per year. The equivalent in price would be $6/user/month for the Teams standard that gives 1TB to each user, so at 2 users and 2TB total you've already got the same price. That's a big difference, even if you don't include the other things that Microsoft 365 Family offers and the integration into Windows.

Proton's cloud storage offering gives 3TB for the Family of up to 6 users - that's 3 TB total shared, not 3TB per user. That's half the storage - maybe enough for many families, but less - and the same user count as Microsoft 365, and comes out at $338 per year. That includes their email hosting, password manager, and VPN. If all of the family switched all of those components, that's not unreasonable, as it would save costs on more than just Microsoft 365 Family. But do I really want to switch all of that, including from the password manager where we do at least have a Canadian company right now? And even if I do, am I really going to convince the rest of the family currently relying on Microsoft 365, like the one who I can't even get to join Signal?

### Password Manager

This is a rare one where Big Tech don't really have that much control. Google, Microsoft, and Apple do have some forms of password manager in their products, but they're not as robust as some of the dedicated offerings. Most of the leaders if you hear knowledgeable people talk about password managers are independent. Of course, most of those are still US based.

1Password is great: independent, Canadian-owned, often at or near the front of the technology, reasonably priced, very user friendly which makes it reasonable to share with family, and has a great security track record. Even if I ended up switching to Proton for other things and get the package that includes their password manager, I might stick with 1Password anyway.

### Search

[I've already written a bit about my experiences testing out Kagi](/2025/types-search/). I like it for good old-fashioned searching for a specific site and the price is entirely reasonable, but I realize that's a relatively small portion of what I use search to do. Bing is still so much better for quick answers like checking the score of the Raptors game. AI chat is much better for working out a complicated coding problem. It's really not that often that I want to find a specific site result.

### Browser

There are a lot of browsers to choose from. Most of them are based on Chromium.

I use Edge the most at work, where I am otherwise a lot in the Microsoft 365 ecosystem, plus if you are doing web development it is the easiest to start in a Chromium browser to target the majority.

I use Firefox at home and on my phone, for a bit more privacy and to support a bit of competition in the space.

### Phone Operating System

For the most part, it's very hard to use any phone operating not owned by either Apple or Google. However, I have considered GrapheneOS on my Pixel phone. It would work by all accounts. I'm just scared of changing the OS of something so important and so expensive.

### Computer Operating System

I myself would probably be fine using Linux. My wife would complain a lot, though. I am not going to buy my own separate computer. I could maybe dual boot, but now we're getting into that zone of needing to do more maintenance work over time.

### Social Media

I haven't used any Meta product in years, since the Rohingya genocide was my last straw.

I did use Twitter a lot, until the world's richest crybaby bought it and drove it into the ground to the point that it is now mostly used for extreme right disinformation and for deepfake porn.

LinkedIn is the one big corporate one I use, which is in a different category as a professional network. It still has a lot of the problems of the big corporate networks, but they aren't a particularly evil company.

I use ActivityPub federated options: Mastodon, Pixelfed, and I have a Loops account but we'll see how much I use it once there is an app in the Play Store.

I also use Bluesky, which is in somewhere in the middle of the scale of totally open protocols and greedy corporate influence.

### Private Chat

I use Signal. I don't use any of the ones with more sketchy security records. I don't even use WhatsApp that seems to have a better security record than the rest of Meta. If somebody isn't on Signal, they get an RCS or at worst SMS message. Signal is one of these techs that I am most evangelistic about because I really do think that it's significantly better and at least as easy as competitors.

It is US-based, but at least it is a non-profit and the nature of the end-to-end encryption is that even if an authoritarian government seizes their servers, there is nothing private that is given away.

### Video Streaming

YouTube is the dominant force.

Nebula is a great option. It's partially owned by the creators who all get paid better per view than they do on YouTube. It's also pretty cheap even if you only watch one or two regular creators in it.

There are also fully open options like PeerTube on the ActivityPub protocol (like Mastodon, Pixelfed, Loops). I don't know anybody who I would follow that uses it, and I am creating video myself. Video hosting is also a lot more expensive, so this is one of the toughest ones to simply replicate well without Big Tech money.

### Music Streaming

We have YouTube Music because that gives ad-free YouTube with it, and because it's already there on our Android phones and TV and speakers.

I would consider something like Tidal to be more ethical, but I don't stream enough music to really feel like it is worth paying for.

### Podcasts

For this one, I really just want to say: use something that supports any RSS feed. Don't use those that have their own shows locked down to only play in their apps.

### Movies

I love physical media. I've got a good quality 4K Blu-ray player. Watching a 4K disc, or even a regular Blu-ray disc with the upscaling, gives you higher quality than streaming, although that gap has closed on a lot of platforms if your Internet can handle it. It also means you own once you pay for it once, not a monthly fee for a service which may not even keep that movie on it forever.

The problem is that some movies, and especially TV, don't even release discs anymore. Sometimes they give you no choice but the streaming.

### TV Operating System

We have a Sony smart TV with Google TV on it. Any TV that has apps is going to be doing a lot of ridiculous data mining. It is still possible to buy TVs without an Internet connection, but of course that means you don't have easy access to the apps you want, so then you buy the extra box that does all the data mining and is less friendly integration. Anything with Roku is even worse for data collection and ads, while having significantly worse app support in Canada and mostly being only on low to mid-range TVs. Samsung doesn't support Dolby Vision at all, so I ruled them out. We considered the higher end of the TCL mini-LED to save a little money, but from everything I read, OLED makes more sense in a basement because of the deeper blacks and would be worth the extra (mini-LED is great in more sunny spaces, though). LG could have worked with their revamped webOS system on it, and all indications are that they are great as well, but ultimately we decided that if we're going to have some massive data mining anyway, we may as well have the best apps and the most integration to all our other Google things.

Plus Sony OLED TVs are good quality including Dolby Vision support that not all the big brands support. The best you can do is set up a Pi Hole to block some of the extra data being sent back and forth. I have not done that yet, but will definitely consider it.

### Smart Home

We bought a house not long after smart home devices started becoming a thing. We immediately needed a new thermostat, so we got an ecobee, a Canadian company with a great reputation so far. That continues to be my favourite smart home thing. We added some Hue bulbs, which are nice but expensive and not as easy to use as I wish they were. We have tried some smart plugs, including the miserable to set up Belkin Wemo that are now no longer supported, which are not really that much more useful than having a power bar with a timer.

The closest thing we have to a hub for managing all of this is Google Home, which is fine. There are some little things like having a "good morning" routine which are nice. But it's not that powerful, and obviously we are sending all the data off to Google for every trivial request, which is less than ideal.

I would like to migrate to Home Assistant. It's not that expensive to get some hardware and then it all runs locally. It's all open source, with a strong community so even if the organization providing some oversight fails the technology would likely survive. From what I've heard, it's a bit of a pain to set up, but once it is, there isn't that much extra maintenance to keep it going.

### Git Repository

This one I hope to get into more later. Right now, I have the things I most want to share on a GitHub (Microsoft) and some other things that specifically need GitLab CI/CD functionality on GitLab instead. There are other options, like the Canadian Worktree and the European Codeberg.

### "AI" Chat

This is still a fairly open area, although it isn't a coincidence that a lot of the most popular ones are also associated with the big tech companies. OpenAI and Anthropic are two that are big and came out of nowhere as technically independent, but they get a lot of their funding and cloud services from Microsoft and Amazon respectively.

There are models that can be run locally, but you need a computer that can run it and some technical expertise. Considering I essentially only it for code, my ideal probably really is to have a model that is highly specialized for Drupal development and run it locally. That would completely keep the big tech companies out, with no subscription fees and no data being sent off to them. I haven't come across anything that is even close to ready for that yet.

In the meantime, there are some smaller companies that seem to have more ethical standards, like [Nous Research](https://nousresearch.com/). I have not tried them at this point. If I do get to a point where I feel like I need to pay a US company, I might on principle try that first and see if it can be maybe not as good but at least good enough.
