Surprise: however many years later, I have actually done something resembling completing the design of this site (and [the matching Theology site](https://theology.ryanrobinson.ca)) using eleventy aka 11ty! I'm sure there are still more things I'll decide to change later, but the general idea I'm pretty happy with. In this series, I'm walking through some of the more complicated components.

For this post, I'm going to look at the sidebars.

Sidebars got a little more tricky than they initially appear because there were some things that I wanted to be on both sites - the posts by tag and posts by year lists - and some freedom to add one or more extras blocks per site.
