## Introduction

There are plenty of good reasons why you should limit your reliance on Big Tech, by which for the English speaking world I primarily mean Meta (Facebook), Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet (Google), and Apple. China in particular does have its own set of tech giants and different socio-political contexts, and I am not pretending to know enough to be talking about them.

In this post I will touch on some of the good reasons why I am trying to be more intentional about trying to reduce my reliance on those big US tech companies. I will follow up with at least one more post going through specific decisions for various categories of software. As I get into those decisions, I think it will become clear how a lot of these factors sometimes come into conflict with each other. Sometimes achieving a gain in one area means a loss in another and you have to decide which one is more importantly this time.

## Enshittification

There is [the enshittification trap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enshittification): the more you rely on a closed system, the more trapped you become. They may drastically raise costs, but you don't have a choice because now you rely on it. They may make it even more closed, like Android making it harder to sideload apps, but since you don't really have any better options you have to accept it. They may shove in even more ads. They may start tracking even more about you. When you're trapped, they can make the product infinitely worse in order to extract just a little more profit and it is very hard to get out.

In other words, I want to give priority to companies that have competition and that have some degree of openness like being able to migrate away to another service without high switching costs.

## Wealth Inequality

There's the wealth inequality: do we really want to keep shoving more and more money at the same handful of executives of giant companies? What if we tried to share the love a little to some smaller companies or in support of open source projects?

My general philosophy is that there is some healthy balance. We don't want 10,000 competing email providers. That's impossible to settle on standards and they will probably largely be bad because of it. But we don't want to get down to only 5 providers either, because then they control an essential method of communication. We need just enough consolidation to be able to settle on protocols and standards and push innovation.

I want to give priority to the non-profits, then the smaller or medium companies who are trying to compete against the giants, or even to open source developers doing good work largely without thanks.

## Data Privacy and Sovereignty

There is the data privacy factor: these Big Tech companies are consolidating a massive amount of information about you and everything you have ever done on the Internet in one place. It is vulnerable to hackers, although I do think that risk is often offset by how these Big Tech companies also often have the best funded security teams to combat them. The other risk that is becoming more obvious, though, especially to those of us outside the United States, is that governments can demand that data. Some of the tech companies will hold the line more than others, only giving up that data when there is a valid search warrant, but others will immediately hand it over without a second thought. If the companies have the data, authoritarian governments can demand it.

I want to give priority to Canadian companies, followed by European ones, before American ones. There may be some companies from other places like China and Japan, but I'm not sure any that come into play for these specific decisions.

## User Friendliness and Accessibility

Their products are often easier to use, since they prioritize getting users locked in before they start the enshittification, compared to a lot of open source projects that are made by computer nerds for computer nerds.

## Integrations

There are often benefits to the integration potential, like (for an almost trivial example) when you have contacts in Google and photos in Google, you can tag people based on the names you already know, and then it will identify by those faces and you have a digital photo frame showing all the photos of your partner and your cat.

## Innovation

Big Tech is often at the cutting edge with new and useful ideas, before a lot of that does trickle out elsewhere.

## Security

Security is still really important, albeit to varying levels depending on the usage. Big Tech often does security better. A lot of the time it is the small and medium companies who are failing, because they don't have the budgets and don't have enough attention on them to be really held accountable.

## Monetary Costs

It shouldn't be the number one priority, but it has to be on the list. It is impossible to pay for everything all the time. You will need to accept the free versions of some things, or giving up data instead, or opting out of that category entirely.

You need to think about monetary cost. Big Tech is often free or cheap on the surface, because they make their money from the data instead. If you want privacy, you probably have to pay for it, whether that's with a one-time cost to buy hardware or software, or a subscription fee, or at the very least considerations to give some donations to open source maintainers. Most of us can't afford to pay for all of the things, but we might be able to pay for some.

That does mean that practically, yes, cheaper is usually better than more expensive, as long as it is still a sustainable business model.

## Effort to Switch

You need to think about how long it will take you to migrate. Is it a quick process, or is a long project that is going to stop you from other things to do with your time?

## Effort to Maintain

Similarly, how much friction is it going to add to your life on an ongoing basis after that? For me, I might do the one-time long migration project, but I get a lot more cautious once I know that it is going to require an extra hour of my life every week to maintain it.

## The Variables to Consider

When considering the possibilities, you need to think about several things.

## Network Effects

The biggest variable, though, is how your decision might impact others. It's one thing to declare that you will only communicate by Signal from now on. That's fine for you, but if others are not willing to make the same change no matter how effectively you explain all the ethical obligations, you've just said that you will never communicate with them again. What do you do: cut them off? Migrate as many people as you can but accept still using something else like WhatsApp for the rest? Or give up because you don't want to juggle multiple messaging apps and who are in each one, settling for using the most popular one no matter how evil it is?
