## The Reasons Why

There are plenty of good reasons why you should limit your reliance on Big Tech, by which for the English speaking world I primarily mean Meta (Facebook), Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet (Google), and Apple. This is likely an incomplete list:

There is the enshittification trap: the more you rely on a closed system, the more trapped you become. They may drastically raise costs, but you don't have a choice because now you rely on it. They may make it even more closed, like Android making it harder to sideload apps, but since you don't really have any better options you have to accept it. They may shove in even more ads. They may start tracking even more about you. When you're trapped, they can make the product infinitely worse in order to extract just a little more profit and it is very hard to get out.

There is the data privacy factor: these Big Tech companies are consolidating a massive amount of information about you and everything you have ever done on the Internet in one place. It is vulnerable to hackers, although I do think that risk is often offset by how these Big Tech companies also often have the best funded security teams to combat them. The other risk that is becoming more obvious, though, especially to those of us outside the United States, is that governments can demand that data. Some of the tech companies will hold the line more than others, only giving up that data when there is a valid search warrant, but others will immediately hand it over without a second thought. If the companies have the data, authoritarian governments can demand it.

There's the wealth inequality: do we really want to keep shoving more and more money at the same handful of executives of giant companies? What if we tried to share the love a little to some smaller companies or in support of open source projects?

There certainly are some very practical advantages of Big Tech as well, like:

- Their products are often easier to use, since they prioritize getting users locked in before they start the enshittification, compared to a lot of open source projects that are made by computer nerds for computer nerds.
- There are often benefits to the integration potential, like (for an almost trivial example) when you have contacts in Google and photos in Google, you can tag people based on the names you already know, and then it will identify by those faces and you have a digital photo frame showing all the photos of your partner and your cat.
- They often are at the cutting edge with new and useful ideas, before a lot of that does trickle out elsewhere.

My general philosophy is that there is some healthy balance. We don't want 10,000 competing email providers. That's impossible to settle on standards and they will probably largely be bad. But we don't want to get down to only 5 providers either, because then they control an essential method of communication. We need just enough consolidation to be able to settle on protocols and standards and push innovation.

## The Variables to Consider

When considering the possibilities, you need to think about several things.

You need to think about how long it will take you to migrate. Is it a quick process, or is a long project that is going to stop you from other things to do with your time? Similarly, how much friction is it going to add to your life on an ongoing basis after that? For me, I might do the one-time long migration project, but I get a lot more cautious once I know that it is going to require an extra hour of my life every week to maintain it.

You need to think about monetary cost. Big Tech is often free or cheap on the surface, because they make their money from the data instead. If you want privacy, you probably have to pay for it, whether that's with a one-time cost to buy hardware or software, or a subscription fee, or at the very least considerations to give some donations to open source maintainers. Most of us can't afford to pay for all of the things, but we might be able to pay for some.

The biggest variable, though, is how your decision might impact others. It's one thing to declare that you will only communicate by Signal from now on. That's fine for you, but if others are not willing to make the same change no matter how effectively you explain all the ethical obligations, you've just said that you will never communicate with them again. What do you do: cut them off? Migrate as many people as you can but accept still using something else like WhatsApp for the rest? Or give up because you don't want to juggle multiple messaging apps and who are in each one, settling for using the most popular one no matter how evil it is?

## Decisions

Here are some of the areas that I have considered. Some I have already made changes. Others I am considering. Others I wish I could but it really doesn't seem realistic.

### Email

I currently have an email with Microsoft. The good news is that my address is a custom domain. That means I could move it somewhere else and nobody else would even notice.

I have absolutely zero interest in hosting my own email.

### Git Repository

This one I hope to get into more later. Right now, I have the things I most want to share on a GitHub (Microsoft) and some other things that specifically need GitLab CI/CD functionality on GitLab instead. There are other options, like the Canadian Worktree and the European Codeberg.

### Search

Kagi vs Bing.

### Phone Operating System

For the most part, it's very hard to use any phone operating not owned by either Apple or Google. However, I have considered GrapheneOS on my Pixel phone. It would work by all accounts. I'm just scared of changing the OS of something so important and so expensive.

### Computer Operating System

I myself would probably be fine using Linux. My wife would complain a lot, though. I am not going to buy my own separate computer. I could maybe dual boot, but now we're getting into that zone of needing to do more maintenance work over time.

### Cloud Storage

I'm currently mostly in OneDrive, with some Google things mostly when needing to be shared.

I have all my photos in OneDrive at full quality. I have a lot of photos with people in them in Google Photos as well, since that makes it easier to find photos by person for things like a digital photo frame or to add a photo to a contact on my phone's address book.
