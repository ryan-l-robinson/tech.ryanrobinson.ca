I'm considering how best to arrange my personal projects in terms of repository.

## GitLab

I use GitLab the most at work, in both my previous job and my current one. That has been the cloud solution and the on-premise one.

There's a lot I like about it, including so many other project management tools built in.

## GitHub

I have used GitHub the most for my personal projects. It's what hosts this website.

It's a bit more streamlined that GitLab is, not throwing as many project management tools at you, but still offering the most important things: the repository itself, issue tracking, CI/CD, free website hosting for static sites.

It also can't be hosted on-premise. You can only use their servers.

## Codeberg

I'm trying codeberg. I like the idea of using the work of a non-profit when I can, and I certainly trust EU businesses more than I do US ones right now.

I don't think it can replace GitHub and GitLab, which still have too many useful components like all the CI/CD as well as integration from GitPod which I use for some situations of building usable Drupal demos. But for projects that don't need any CI or anything, I might try to keep a copy on Codeberg as well.

## Worktree

I need to include a Canadian option here: [worktree.ca](https://about.worktree.ca/). It is definitely the most minimal and the newest entry to this list.

## Conclusion

What I am going to try to do is have the GitLab be the primary, because they offer a way to duplicate repositories there to elsewhere. Then I have copies on each of the others, or at least some of the others, depending on the project.
