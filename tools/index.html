<p>Here are some of my favourite tools I make use of in my tech work:</p>
<h2 id="text-editor" tabindex="-1">Text Editor <a class="header-anchor" href="#text-editor">#</a></h2>
<p><a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a>: an editor that manages to be extremely powerful with a lot of features and extension support even while being relatively lightweight. <a href="/tags/visual-studio-code/">See blog posts tagged as Visual Studio Code</a>.</p>
<h2 id="terminals" tabindex="-1">Terminals <a class="header-anchor" href="#terminals">#</a></h2>
<p><a href="https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/9N0DX20HK701?hl=en-us&amp;gl=US">Windows Terminal</a>: a pleasant terminal in Windows that incorporates all your shells in one app. This is now default on Windows 11 but requires downloading it separately on Windows 10.</p>
<p><a href="https://putty.org/">PuTTy</a>: a great option to save multiple SSH connections to servers, with a lot of configuration settings to navigate different requirements.</p>
<h2 id="code-repositories" tabindex="-1">Code Repositories <a class="header-anchor" href="#code-repositories">#</a></h2>
<p>Git with <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/">GitLab</a> or <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a>: for the most part I use GitLab professionally and GitHub personally. GitLab gives a bit more project management tools out of the box, but they're both great.</p>
<h2 id="accessibility-testing" tabindex="-1">Accessibility Testing <a class="header-anchor" href="#accessibility-testing">#</a></h2>
<p><a href="https://wave.webaim.org/">WAVE</a>: testing tools including a browser extension that can help highlight accessibility issues while you browse the site.</p>
<p><a href="https://pa11y.org/">Pa11y</a>: testing tools that are especially great from a command line, including being able to incorporate them into CI/CD pipeline tests.</p>
<p><a href="http://brandwood.com/a11y/">Brandwood</a>: a tool that is specifically helpful for finding contrast errors of text against an image background. <a href="/websites/brandwood-a11y/">See my blog post about Brandwood</a>.</p>
<h2 id="database-management" tabindex="-1">Database Management <a class="header-anchor" href="#database-management">#</a></h2>
<p><a href="https://www.mysql.com/products/workbench/">MySQL Workbench</a>: a heavy-duty database tool that lets you see the database in convenient table views, edit inline, and run other commands. <a href="/websites/mysql-workbench/">See my blog post about MySQL Workbench</a>.</p>

<h2 id="tech-podcasts" tabindex="-1">Tech Podcasts <a class="header-anchor" href="#tech-podcasts">#</a></h2>
<p>Most of these podcasts are not directly related to any of my work, but they are all smart people tackling interesting topics:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.relay.fm/rocket">Rocket</a>: &quot;accelerated geek conversation&quot; that explores news in technology along with some &quot;dessert&quot; around other geeky topics. Possibly my favourite podcast in terms of how well the hosts complement each other's skills and knowledge areas.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.humanetech.com/podcast">Your Undivided Attention</a>: exploring the human consequences of decisions we make with technologies, especially the social media engagement model, from the Center for Human Technology.</li>
<li><a href="https://twit.tv/shows/windows-weekly">Windows Weekly</a>: news and analysis all about Microsoft.</li>
<li><a href="https://twit.tv/shows/this-week-in-tech">This Week in Tech</a>: a panel show covering all kinds of tech news of the past week and discussing its implications.</li>
<li><a href="https://intrazone.libsyn.com/">The Intrazone by Microsoft</a>: this is an official corporate one, which does tend to be more promotional and definitely less critical, but it is a valuable way to keep up with news in the world of SharePoint and related technologies.</li>
</ul>
