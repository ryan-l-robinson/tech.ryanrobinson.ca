## Overview

This is the technology blog of Ryan Robinson, built using Eleventy.

## TODO

It is now functional but I haven't finished cleaning up all the content yet.

Theme:

- Pagination is too big for small screens. I either need less items showing always, or I need to implement JavaScript to show less only on smaller screens.
- When I add an image using FrontMatter, it adds to a bad path, not relative to the post. Is that avoidable?
- This won't be a problem for a while but the paths for years and the paths for pages of all posts could conflict, once there is 2021 pages of posts. It probably won't ever be an issue for me because I'm not writing that much, but in principle it should still have some way to handle it.

Existing Content:

- Posts: add more series descriptions, taking any introduction out of each post.
- Posts: Review tags on existing posts for consistency
- Posts: add descriptions to all posts (must be in quotes to appear), review tags and series, remove categories that aren't doing anything, update image paths, update link paths.
- Update links in dev.to to point to the new addresses.
