# Ryan Robinson Technology

This is the technology blog of Ryan Robinson, built using Eleventy.

## TODO

- Static pages About and Tools: fix images
- Posts overall list: add pagination to view posts in blocks of 20 or so at a time instead of all at once.
- Posts page: add a general posts page at /posts so that the URL is consistent, even if the page is the same as home.
- Individual post display: show the description at the top, in a separately styled box, as a brief overview.
- Posts by year: add a page for each year, filtering to that year.
- Sidebar: list of tags? list by year?
- Posts: add descriptions to all posts, review tags, remove categories that aren't doing anything
- Header: add a search box - there's probably an eleventy module for that?
- Different colour scheme for dark vs light mode
- Remove the homepage message box. Keep the functionality in case I want to use that again, or cut it out entirely?
- Clean up anything left over from the base theme that I didn't use
