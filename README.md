# Ryan Robinson Technology

This is the technology blog of Ryan Robinson, built using Eleventy.

## TODO

- Change base font to Atkinson Hyperlegible
- Sidebar: responsive, larger font, link back to the main ryanrobinson.ca, RSS feed link
- Header: Site name, ideally a search box
- Static pages About and Tools: add styles
- Homepage: longer list of all posts in a readable way
- Posts: template and styles
- Clean up anything left over from the base theme that I didn't use

## Features

	- Can easily [deploy to a subfolder without changing any content](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/plugins/html-base/)
	- All URLs are decoupled from the contentâ€™s location on the file system.
	- Configure templates via the [Eleventy Data Cascade](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/data-cascade/)
- **Performance focused**: four-hundos Lighthouse score out of the box!
	- [View the Lighthouse report for the latest build](https://eleventy-base-blog.netlify.app/reports/lighthouse/) courtesy of the [Netlify Lighthouse plugin](https://github.com/netlify/netlify-plugin-lighthouse).

#### Content Security Policy

If your site enforces a [Content Security Policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP) (as public-facing sites should), you have a few choices (pick one):

1. In `base.njk`, remove `<style>{% getBundle "css" %}</style>` and uncomment `<link rel="stylesheet" href="{% getBundleFileUrl "css" %}">`
2. Configure the server with the CSP directive `style-src: 'unsafe-inline'` (less secure).
