# Ryan Robinson Technology

This is the technology blog of Ryan Robinson, built using Eleventy.

## TODO

- Header and Footer: fix the widths so that it doesn't go full-width on small screens, but does below that
- Header: add a search box - there's probably an eleventy module for that?
- Static pages About and Tools: fix images, update content
- Posts: add descriptions to all posts, add pagination to view posts in blocks of 20 or so at a time instead of all at once
- Different colour scheme for dark vs light mode
- Clean up anything left over from the base theme that I didn't use
