# Ryan Robinson Technology

This is the technology blog of Ryan Robinson, built using Eleventy.

## TODO

- Update to eleventy 3.0, now in beta
- Static pages About and Tools: fix images
- Add images used in posts
- Posts overall list: add pagination to view posts in blocks of 20 or so at a time instead of all at once, show tags.
- Individual post display: show the description at the top, in a separately styled box, as a brief overview.
- Add another taxonomy, like tags but for specific series of posts?
- Sidebar: improve styles
- Tags page? Posts page? Posts by year page? These are possibilities implied by the URL patterns, but don't exist (tags used to but I deleted it because they're already in the sidebar)
- Posts: add descriptions to all posts, review tags, remove categories that aren't doing anything, update image paths
- Header: add a search box - there's probably an eleventy module for that?
- Remove the homepage message box. Keep the functionality in case I want to use that again, or cut it out entirely?
