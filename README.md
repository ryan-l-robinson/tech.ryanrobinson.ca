# Ryan Robinson Technology

This is the technology blog of Ryan Robinson, built using Eleventy.

## TODO

- Add another taxonomy, like tags but for specific series of posts. Add corresponding sidebar block that only shows up on posts with a series and shows all others in that series, in order.
- Tags page? Posts page? Posts by year page? These are possibilities implied by the URL patterns, but don't exist (tags used to but I deleted it because they're already in the sidebar)
- About/Tools page: fix images and review links for accuracy. Include the page title.
- Posts: add descriptions to all posts, review tags, remove categories that aren't doing anything, update image paths, update link paths.
- Header: add a search box - there's probably an eleventy module for that? https://rknight.me/blog/using-pagefind-with-eleventy-for-search/
- Add broken link checker? 3.0 does protect against references to non-existent images, but I don't think it does against links.
- Remove the homepage message box. Keep the functionality in case I want to use that again.
