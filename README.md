# Ryan Robinson Technology

This is the technology blog of Ryan Robinson, built using Eleventy.

## TODO

- Header: add a search box - there's probably an eleventy module for that?
- Static pages About and Tools: fix images
- Sidebar: list of tags?
- Posts display: add pagination to view posts in blocks of 20 or so at a time instead of all at once
- Posts: add descriptions to all posts, review tags
- Different colour scheme for dark vs light mode
- Clean up anything left over from the base theme that I didn't use
