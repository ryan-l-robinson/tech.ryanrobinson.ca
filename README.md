# Ryan Robinson Technology

This is the technology blog of Ryan Robinson, built using Eleventy.

## TODO

- Update to eleventy 3.0, now in beta.
- Posts overall list: add pagination to view posts in blocks of 20 or so at a time instead of all at once.
- Individual post display: show the description at the top, in a separately styled box, as a brief overview.
- Add another taxonomy, like tags but for specific series of posts?
- Tags page? Posts page? Posts by year page? These are possibilities implied by the URL patterns, but don't exist (tags used to but I deleted it because they're already in the sidebar)
- About/Tools page: fix images and review links for accuracy.
- Posts: add descriptions to all posts, review tags, remove categories that aren't doing anything, update image paths, update link paths.
- Header: add a search box - there's probably an eleventy module for that?
- Add broken link checker?
- Remove the homepage message box. Keep the functionality in case I want to use that again.
