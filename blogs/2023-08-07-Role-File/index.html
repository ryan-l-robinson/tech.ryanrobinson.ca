<p>A while ago I wrote about, and shared sample code for, adding a role to a user when they log in if their name appears in a file on the server. That was a Drupal 7 sample.</p>
<p>I've now updated that for Drupal 9 and created <a href="https://github.com/ryan-l-robinson/drupal-9-permissions-from-file">a project in my GitHub</a>. It's relatively straightforward so I won't provide a line by line breakdown again.</p>
