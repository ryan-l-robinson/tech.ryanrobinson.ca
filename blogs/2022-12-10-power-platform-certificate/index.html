<p>This week I completed a new certification! I am now Microsoft certified as a <a href="https://www.credly.com/badges/f62e6037-44d4-4ee2-9fd8-a83b84500910/public_url">Power Platform App Maker Associate,</a>, having completed <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/certifications/exams/pl-100">the PL-100 exam</a>. This covers a lot of the introductory understanding of the Power Platform including Power Apps, Power Automate, Power BI, and Power Virtual Agent. There's a lot of great tools in here and I'm happy that I've gotten a good introductory grasp of them.</p>
<p>It is listed on the <a href="/eleventy-base-blog/about">about page</a> along with my other certifications.</p>
