<p>This is not my usual type of content for this site, but I was reminded of it from a Mastodon conversation and wanted to put it somewhere more or less permanent. Before building the latest iteration of my church's website several years ago, I put out the question on Twitter for what information people want before they would consider visiting. I sent those to the church leadership and still had the document, so I looked it up to summarize those questions again below:</p>
<h2 id="sunday-worship" tabindex="-1">Sunday Worship <a class="header-anchor" href="#sunday-worship">#</a></h2>
<p>When does the service begin and end?</p>
<p>Is there a nursery for infants and toddlers? Something for children and youth?</p>
<p>Are children welcome in the service, even if they make noise?</p>
<p>Is there adult education?</p>
<p>What's the (usually unspoken) dress code?</p>
<p>Is there parking? Bike racks? Transit nearby?</p>
<p>Where's the main entrance?</p>
<p>Is there coffee available?</p>
<h2 id="inclusivity" tabindex="-1">Inclusivity <a class="header-anchor" href="#inclusivity">#</a></h2>
<p>Is the building accessible with a wheelchair?</p>
<p>Is there assistance for those with hearing impairments?</p>
<p>(You could add more specific disabilities)</p>
<p>Are women or non-binary people involved in leadership? Could they be a pastor?</p>
<p>Do you have a gender neutral washroom?</p>
<p>Could an LGBTQ+ person be your pastor?</p>
<p>Would your pastor marry a same-sex couple?</p>
<p>How well does the racial demographics of the church match the wider community?</p>
<h2 id="other-ministries" tabindex="-1">Other Ministries <a class="header-anchor" href="#other-ministries">#</a></h2>
<p>Is there a youth group? What do they do? How often do they meet? What's your understanding of youth discipleship?</p>
<p>What areas of social justice and community work do you do?</p>
<p>What social groups can I join?</p>
<p>What about Prayer groups? Or Bible study groups?</p>
<h2 id="rental-of-facilities" tabindex="-1">Rental of Facilities <a class="header-anchor" href="#rental-of-facilities">#</a></h2>
<p>Can I use the space for weddings or concerts?</p>
<p>Do I have to be a member?</p>
<p>How many does it seat?</p>
<p>What does it cost? Is there any discount (or free) for indigenous groups whose land you are on?</p>
<h2 id="theology" tabindex="-1">Theology <a class="header-anchor" href="#theology">#</a></h2>
<p>Most did not want a full statement of faith on every possible question, but they wanted to know key values of the community that shape how the church tackles all those other questions.</p>
<p>Are you starting from the love of God or from an inerrant Bible or something else?</p>
<p>Is there a denominational affiliation?</p>
<h2 id="other" tabindex="-1">Other <a class="header-anchor" href="#other">#</a></h2>
<p>Can I donate online?</p>
<p>How do I contact someone and who do I contact for what needs?</p>
<p>Can I see a calendar of upcoming events?</p>
