<p><a href="https://xdebug.org/">XDebug</a> is a helpful tool when debugging PHP code. XDebug is a step debugging tools that helps you inspect functionality of PHP code in a cleaner way than regularly writing dump/log statements.</p>
<p>I will not get into details here about setting up XDebug on a server, but you can find that with some Internet searching. Instead, this post is about how to use XDebug within Visual Studio Code.</p>

<p>First, install <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=xdebug.php-debug">the extension PHP Debug (xdebug.php-debug) from the Visual Studio Code extension directory</a>.</p>

<h3 id="start-the-listener" tabindex="-1">Start the Listener <a class="header-anchor" href="#start-the-listener">#</a></h3>
<p>To start the XDebug listener:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to the “Run and Debug” tab (Ctrl + Shift + D) in the main app sidebar.</li>
<li>Click the play button beside the XDebug listener. Depending on your developer environment, you may have other listeners as well.</li>
</ol>
<p>A small window will be added to your workspace with a few buttons. While everything is running smoothly, it will be a pause, a stop, and a restart button. While stopped because of a breakpoint, it will provide other options to continue, step over, step into, and step out.</p>

<h3 id="monitor-notices-warnings-etc" tabindex="-1">Monitor Notices, Warnings, etc <a class="header-anchor" href="#monitor-notices-warnings-etc">#</a></h3>
<p>You can monitor for any notices, warnings, errors, or exceptions that occur while the listener is running.</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to the “Run and Debug” tab (Ctrl + Shift + D) in the main app sidebar.</li>
<li>If it is collapsed, expand the “Breakpoints” accordion section.</li>
<li>Select under what conditions you want to break and show you results, e.g. Notices, Warnings.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="add-a-breakpoint" tabindex="-1">Add a Breakpoint <a class="header-anchor" href="#add-a-breakpoint">#</a></h3>
<p>You can add a breakpoint at a line in the code and have XDebug report the value of variables as of the start of that line.</p>
<ol>
<li>In the VS Code editor for the code you want to check, scroll to the left of the line of code you want to break. This will cause a little red dot to appear. Click on that red dot to create the breakpoint.</li>
<li>Carry out your test scenario (e.g. load the page that calls that PHP in your browser).</li>
<li>See the results with the values of each variable at the breakpoint, within the Run and Debug window in VS Code.</li>
</ol>
