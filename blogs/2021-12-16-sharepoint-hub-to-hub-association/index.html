<p>A long-awaited feature has arrived in SharePoint: <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/SharePoint/hub-to-hub-association">the ability to associate one hub site with another hub site</a>. Over a year ago I saw references to a PowerShell cmdlet to do this in the official documentation pages, but with a note that it was in limited preview so most of us wouldn’t be able to do it yet. Now it has finally rolled out to general availability.</p>
<h2 id="why-do-this" tabindex="-1">Why do this <a class="header-anchor" href="#why-do-this">#</a></h2>
<p>Associating one hub with another hub changes one thing: search results. If you’re in one hub and do a search, results from other associated hubs can be prioritized alongside other sites in the same hub. This is a nice extra level of controlling your search results for a pretty common scenario.</p>
<p>For example, imagine being in a small team with lots of projects. You want a site for every project, associated to your team’s hub site (for the search results, for a sites web part, etc). But your team is also a part of a larger department and you may have a lot of useful general resources on that site. Now when you search from your team’s SharePoint you can get results in both directions: the projects in the same hub and the general documents of the associated department hub.</p>
<h2 id="what-it-doesn-t-do" tabindex="-1">What it doesn’t do <a class="header-anchor" href="#what-it-doesn-t-do">#</a></h2>
<p>It does not change any of the other things that come with the first level of hub association, most of which makes sense if you think about them.</p>
<p>Navigation doesn’t change. There is a shared hub menu. Nothing from the associated hub’s navigation will appear. But it makes sense that it doesn’t really work to have two conflicting navigation areas.</p>
<p>The automatic application of site designs for all sites in a hub also stays as only sites in that hub. This makes sense for the same reason navigation does: you can’t really have two site designs applied to the same site at once.</p>
<p>The sites web part, with the setting to filter by hub associations, doesn’t change. This one I think could make sense to expand, for scenarios much like the search: it could have one filter setting for only sites in this hub and another filter for sites in associated hubs as well. I may be missing something for why that couldn’t work, so maybe that feature will come later.</p>
