<p><a href="/eleventy-base-blog/microsoft-365/enrolling-devices-in-endpoint-manager/">You’ve got your devices enrolled in Endpoint Manager</a>. Now what? This opens up lots of tools including configuration policies.</p>
<p>Configuration policies allow for quickly rolling out the desired configuration to the device, without the user having to manually set it up. This can include a lot of different settings and vary by the operating system of the device. Some of the more interesting tools for Windows 10 includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Email, contacts, calendar, and tasks (add the account corresponding to the user logged in)</li>
<li>Restrict apps to only those from the Store</li>
<li>Block access to system settings</li>
<li>Password requirements</li>
<li>Start menu</li>
<li>Battery saver settings</li>
<li>Edition upgrade (from Pro to Enterprise)</li>
<li>Domain join</li>
<li>VPN</li>
<li>Wi-Fi</li>
<li>Windows Hello for Business</li>
</ul>

<p>VPN particularly stands out to me in the age of COVID-19 and lots of people working from home. Setting up a VPN is not something that is intuitive to most users. With a device configuration profile, they don’t have to figure that out themselves or lose time letting an IT staff member remote access to set it up.</p>
<p>That’s not a comprehensive list. Ultimately, you can do a lot which helps save the user time configuring themselves and/or helps enforce some security blocking them from features they don’t need.</p>
