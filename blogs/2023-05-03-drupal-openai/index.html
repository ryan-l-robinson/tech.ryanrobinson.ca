<p>AI, or more specifically large language models (LMMs) are all the rage these days, so it shouldn't come as too much of a surprise that there is now <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/openai">a Drupal module that integrates OpenAI</a>.</p>
<p>It is only an alpha release but includes several submodules to leverage OpenAI tools within a Drupal site in various ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Generate content for you in any content type</li>
<li>Speech to text</li>
<li>Interaction with the ChatGPT prompt endpoint</li>
<li>A button in CKEditor to send a prompt to OpenAI and get text back</li>
<li>Assistance in the content editing process, such as adjusting your tone and summarizing body text</li>
<li>Analyzes logs to summarize likely problems</li>
</ul>
<p>I haven't given it a try yet, mainly because I do not have a paid OpenAI API key and I assume I cannot use this without one, but it definitely could be worthwhile in certain Drupal site contexts.</p>
