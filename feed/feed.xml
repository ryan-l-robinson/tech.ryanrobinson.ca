    <title>Early Thoughts with Vivaldi</title>
    <link href="https://tech.ryanrobinson.ca/2026/vivaldi/" />
    <updated>2026-02-01T13:55:09Z</updated>
    <id>https://tech.ryanrobinson.ca/2026/vivaldi/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;As I noted briefly in &lt;a href=&quot;https://tech.ryanrobinson.ca/2026/big-tech-decisions/&quot;&gt;a previous post&lt;/a&gt;, I was not feeling any particular need to switch my personal browser from Firefox to anything else, or my work browser from Edge to anything else. Then I saw a reference from &lt;a href=&quot;https://vivaldi.com&quot;&gt;Vivaldi&lt;/a&gt; on Mastodon to a really interesting new feature that to my knowledge no other browser has. I will get into that feature a bit more below, but that feature - and the coincidental timing of when I am already reevaluating a lot of my tech choices - gave me enough of a prompt to give it a try.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After one workday of trying to use it and some experiments with it at home, here are my thoughts so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;getting-started&quot;&gt;Getting Started&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first natural thing to do is try to import all your settings from a previous browser, to avoid having to repeat setting things up. There are options in Vivaldi to do that from Edge and from Chrome. Oddly, there&#39;s no way to import my data from Firefox, which is what had been my primary personal browser previously, so I&#39;m out of luck there entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Importing from Edge, which I tried on my work computer, is possible but with a bit of pain. It requires that Edge be closed. On Windows 11, Edge is never closed; it&#39;s always running in the background. To be able to import from it into Vivaldi, I needed to open Task Manager and end the task. There was no prompt to help you do this. I suppose the kind of people who are going to try Vivaldi are mostly the kind of people like me who would know how to do this, but it was a little strange.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;tab-management&quot;&gt;Tab Management&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&#39;s the feature that prompted me to try it: &lt;a href=&quot;https://vivaldi.com/blog/vivaldi-on-desktop-7-8/&quot;&gt;tab tiling&lt;/a&gt;. At least in theory, this is an extremely useful and convenient way to view two pages at once. This was something I saw and immediately imagined I would use a lot, like having one page of the site I&#39;m testing and the issue summary side by side. In my few attempts at using it, it works as advertised. It&#39;s easy to use. It&#39;s easy to discover by accident (even if you try to drag a tab out to make a new window, you might notice the indicators that you could drop it into this same window). I have no notes for improvement on that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It does some other interesting things with tab management as well, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It does have vertical tabs but it doesn&#39;t conveniently expand and collapse, aka auto hide, like it does on Edge or Firefox. Instead, it is one adjustable size at all times. I really like how Edge and Firefox keep the tabs out of the way when I don&#39;t need them, but then expands to be able to view them when I do scroll my mouse over there. This isn&#39;t a big deal on a wide enough monitor to still see all of the site anyway, but it just feels like another in my sentiment so far that Vivaldi has great ideas but is a little rough in implementation. Then came some good news: after I found a forum discussion requesting this feature, somebody replied saying that it &amp;quot;will probably come to 7.9 Final in a few months, but the feature needs some more polishing before it is ready.&amp;quot; I&#39;m hoping this is the case, and with a bit more patience I will have what is currently my largest lost functionality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also offers tab stacking, roughly equivalent to what at least Edge calls grouping. It&#39;s a way to minimize the space required for tabs, and making it more obvious which tabs go together, while still keeping them somewhat accessible. It has three options for how those stacks appear:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the Compact view:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://tech.ryanrobinson.ca/2026/vivaldi/MbbQdJ4ubs-278.avif 278w&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://tech.ryanrobinson.ca/2026/vivaldi/MbbQdJ4ubs-278.webp 278w&quot;&gt;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; src=&quot;https://tech.ryanrobinson.ca/2026/vivaldi/MbbQdJ4ubs-278.png&quot; alt=&quot;&amp;quot;Compact stack has a small line for each other tab within the stack, above the stack name.&amp;quot;&quot; width=&quot;278&quot; height=&quot;43&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the name suggests, this minimizes the space required. It is also the least obvious at a glance that there even are other tabs there. If you scroll over the little line above the stack name, you do get a preview of that tab to remind you what it is before clicking on it, which is a necessity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the two-level view:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://tech.ryanrobinson.ca/2026/vivaldi/Dzpo4nbvar-283.avif 283w&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://tech.ryanrobinson.ca/2026/vivaldi/Dzpo4nbvar-283.webp 283w&quot;&gt;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; src=&quot;https://tech.ryanrobinson.ca/2026/vivaldi/Dzpo4nbvar-283.png&quot; alt=&quot;&amp;quot;Two level stack view has an extra column of sidebar, where the stack name is in the left with rest of the tabs and the tabs within it are in the second section.&amp;quot;&quot; width=&quot;283&quot; height=&quot;232&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is other extreme, with needing a lot of space but making it really easy to tell which tabs are within the stack. Maybe if I had an ultrawide monitor I would like this more, but as is, it makes my challenges with the vertical tabs not auto-hiding even more of a challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, this is the accordion view:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://tech.ryanrobinson.ca/2026/vivaldi/mobke2f6L1-275.avif 275w&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://tech.ryanrobinson.ca/2026/vivaldi/mobke2f6L1-275.webp 275w&quot;&gt;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; src=&quot;https://tech.ryanrobinson.ca/2026/vivaldi/mobke2f6L1-275.png&quot; alt=&quot;&amp;quot;Accordion stack view allows the stack of tabs to expand or collapse&amp;quot;&quot; width=&quot;275&quot; height=&quot;86&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is in the middle in terms of space consumed, and is overall my favourite. When collapsed, it takes up about the same amount of space as two tabs, but it is also much more obvious that it is a stack and what you need to do to look within it compared to the compact view, and doesn&#39;t require an extra column of space like the two-level view. It isn&#39;t as clean of a look as how Edge handles tab groups, but it&#39;s the same idea. I&#39;ll leave it on that setting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Workspaces concept takes the grouping of tabs idea to another level. This is a toggle at the top of the tab bar. You can create a new workspace with a completely different set of tabs. They stay saved and accessible, even when closing Vivaldi in between, just tucked away behind that toggle not taking up space and confusing you on which tabs are related to what you&#39;re doing right now. I&#39;m not sure how much I&#39;ll really use this. In my previous job doing client based work, when I sometimes had to do a lot of flipping between multiple clients, getting sidelined from one to address something more urgent for another, this might have helped more to keep each project straight. I could have had one workspace for each client, only closing each bundle of tabs when I finished that client&#39;s task. There is some degree that it is still true now that I can be juggling multiple distinct tasks, but mostly I think those rise to the level of groups/stacks, not workspaces. It&#39;s a good idea, just maybe not for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;security-and-privacy&quot;&gt;Security and Privacy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to tab management, security and privacy is the area that Vivaldi is most known for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s built on Chromium, but the fact that Chromium can no longer install full power ad blockers doesn&#39;t matter because Vivaldi has its own ad blocking built in. I did find at least one site where Vivaldi mobile failed to block the ads and it was jarring how terrible of an experience that is when you&#39;re used to not seeing them. That same site did block successfully on desktop. Maybe it isn&#39;t perfect, but it is probably at least pretty close, and I appreciate that it is there by default.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proton VPN is built-in as well. You&#39;re only a click away from one of the best VPN solutions, even if you don&#39;t have a paid Proton account. Considering I also just signed up for a Proton account as a part of my attempts to limit my US Big Tech, I went ahead and signed in, but until I start paying for Proton there probably isn&#39;t any advantage to that. For free, it will automatically connect you to the fastest available server, and of the 10 countries available in the free level, Canada is one of them. As long as I just want security and not to choose where specifically to spoof that I am accessing from, the free version is fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;other-ui&quot;&gt;Other UI&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vivaldi is loaded with customization options, not just the ones about tab management and security I already covered. This is the power user browser. I&#39;m not sure any of these are truly revolutionary, but it is still nice to see so much freedom to make it your own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://tech.ryanrobinson.ca/2026/vivaldi/PTx4xm2go2-972.avif 972w&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://tech.ryanrobinson.ca/2026/vivaldi/PTx4xm2go2-972.webp 972w&quot;&gt;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; src=&quot;https://tech.ryanrobinson.ca/2026/vivaldi/PTx4xm2go2-972.png&quot; alt=&quot;&amp;quot;The settings page, which includes a lot of sections with a lot of options under each, and a search bar to help you find a specific setting.&amp;quot;&quot; width=&quot;972&quot; height=&quot;795&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were a few defaults I did not like but I did find settings to change them which I haven&#39;t already mentioned:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One was the progress bar on the tab when refreshing or loading a new page. When on that tab, I couldn&#39;t see the progress bar at all, so I couldn&#39;t tell that it was still trying to refresh. That means when I was debugging an error, I couldn&#39;t tell if the error was still there or if the page just hadn&#39;t refreshed yet. Sometimes when working with locally-hosted Docker container sites, it isn&#39;t obvious if it is just being slow or not. I found a setting that shows a circular indicator in place of the favicon in the tabs bar and like that better. This one I kind of think is a weird choice for the default.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another default I didn&#39;t like was hiding the parameters in the URL of the address bar. This made it more annoying to debug something that involved the parameters. I found a setting to change that as well. I get why most people doing most casual browsing don&#39;t need to see those parameters and this is an entirely reasonable default, but when I&#39;m developing, I do sometimes need them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of developing, the Inspect Element is hidden under an extra layer of menu labelled &amp;quot;Developer Tools.&amp;quot; That&#39;s obvious enough, but it means every time I want to inspect an element, I have that extra layer to navigate, and I inspect element a lot in my work. That doesn&#39;t have a clear setting for it, but buried under Appearance are options to customize what appears in what menu. I was able from there to move the developer tools up a level. It&#39;s a little clunky, but again this does make sense as a default: the people that don&#39;t want developer tools want them somewhat hidden under an extra layer, and the people that do will figure out how to change the setting even if it isn&#39;t that obvious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;bookmarks&quot;&gt;Bookmarks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bookmarks are giving me the most trouble so far. Since there is no tool to import everything from Firefox, I tried to import at least my bookmarks. I went to Firefox and exported as HTML. Then I went back to Vivaldi, found an Import tool which allowed from HTML, and used that. The Vivaldi interface says it imported, but no bookmarks showed up. Then I gave up and tried to add a bookmark manually, and that didn&#39;t work either. I click on the button to add bookmark from the address bar and it doesn&#39;t do anything. I click on the + button within the bookmarks window and it doesn&#39;t do anything. Then it got even stranger: I checked it on mobile, after trying on desktop multiple times, and saw multiple copies of imported bookmarks. They somehow got imported and synced, but they don&#39;t even show up on the device that I imported them on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Update: I tried importing again a few days later. It worked instantly this time. Maybe I got a bug fix update, or maybe something else weird was going on that I can&#39;t explain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another minor bookmarks nuisance is that it is tied to the right sidebar. I don&#39;t really want anything else from the right sidebar. Nicely, I could move the button to open bookmarks into other toolbars - that&#39;s great. When I click on it, it opens the bookmarks, as well as the rest of the right sidebar. Then when I close the bookmarks, it doesn&#39;t close the sidebar again. It&#39;s a minor nuisance, and I don&#39;t rely on bookmarks so much that it will really add up, but it&#39;s another in the &amp;quot;rough around the edges&amp;quot; category.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;email-calendar-and-feeds&quot;&gt;Email, Calendar, and Feeds&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have to note that it also includes an email client. This is IMAP only, so if like me you are currently using an Outlook.com account, or considering moving to a Proton account, that is a step down compared to ActiveSync in desktop Outlook and the Proton app functionality respectively. It also includes a calendar app. Because these are only IMAP, I did not bother trying it. I don&#39;t think there&#39;s any real scenario that I will use it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vivaldi also includes feeds. Sort of. As far as I can find, there is no view to go to that shows all my feeds in one place. There is a button for &amp;quot;Feeds&amp;quot; in the Toolbar Editor but it refuses to add it to any of the toolbar areas, so I have no idea what that is supposed to go to. What did clearly work was a notification when there is a new post on a feed. That&#39;s maybe sometimes useful for certain feeds that I really need to know about right away, but for the most part not what I&#39;m looking for. I hope it has a desktop equivalent to what I do with Start Launcher on Android, having my own customized news page that I can browse, and I just can&#39;t figure out how to open it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;mobile&quot;&gt;Mobile&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vivaldi also has a mobile app with sync between installations if you login. For the most part, I&#39;ve had no rough edges yet except for one:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&#39;s some weird duplication. When clicking on the button in the bottom left, I see Bookmarks, History, Notes, Downloads, and Translate. There is another longer menu that opens from the button on the bottom right. Among other things, that includes... Bookmarks, History, Notes, Downloads, Translate. I&#39;d be happy to get rid of the one in the bottom left, because I really do not know what it is solving that isn&#39;t already solved by the full menu, but I did not find a way to do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now, I think my plan is to continue trying it out more for personal use on desktop and mobile, but not change from Edge at work yet. That largely comes down to what I&#39;ve said throughout this post: there are a lot of good ideas, some of which I would probably benefit from, but there are a lot of rough edges, too. Personal use can afford to be a bit more experimental and put up with those rough edges than work use can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;personal-use-vs-firefox&quot;&gt;Personal Use: vs Firefox&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compared to Firefox for personal use, there are some advantages and some disadvantages. Firefox has worse tab management overall, but wins on that one simple factor that is always noticeable, the vertical tabs hiding out of the way. That problem might go away with the next Vivaldi release. A lot of the other tab management feature advantages for Vivaldi are mostly theoretical for me at this point, with maybe the occasional use for tab tiling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firefox has (a little) worse security built in, with no default VPN and needing another extension for ad blocking, but it&#39;s not hard to install Proton VPN on the computer separately or to install an ad blocker to Firefox separately so in practice it&#39;s not a major difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The argument might really just be over which company&#39;s mission and structure I like better. Firefox has been around longer, and it&#39;s important that they offer the rare non-Chromium browser option. They&#39;re based in the US. The Mozilla corporation describes itself as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a non-profit organization that promotes openness, innovation and participation on the Internet&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vivaldi is Norwegian, smaller and with less of a history. They describe their two ground rules for the browser as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;privacy is a default, and everything&#39;s an option&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They are both good missions. Vivaldi&#39;s is a little more precise in its guiding principles but which of those approaches is better is debatable. Firefox maybe gets a bit of an edge for not being Chromium and for a longer track record as being the most viable not Big Tech alternative. Vivaldi gets a bit of an edge for really pushing the limits on innovation and privacy, as well as being EU based instead of US based.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;work-use-vs-edge&quot;&gt;Work Use: vs Edge&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At work has different calculus. It&#39;s true that&#39;s where the tab tiling and other management tools would be more useful, since that is generally when I am juggling a lot of tabs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I also have a work Microsoft 365 account, on a managed Windows Enterprise device. There are some advantages in ease of use to tie everything to that one managed account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of those little rough edges I&#39;ve named would also matter more in a work context doing something repeatedly and often in a hurry. Those might add up to more lost time than is saved by the tab tiling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m always going to be a bit more conservative about changes I make at work, where the impacts are higher, so I think I&#39;ll stick with Edge there for now. But if I am trying Vivaldi more at home, then I will be more aware of those couple rough edges do get smoothed out in such a way that using it at work would make more sense. That leaves the door open that it could also become my work browser, just not yet.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Decisions on Software Categories</title>
    <link href="https://tech.ryanrobinson.ca/2026/big-tech-decisions/" />
    <updated>2026-01-24T17:18:09Z</updated>
    <id>https://tech.ryanrobinson.ca/2026/big-tech-decisions/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In the previous post, &lt;a href=&quot;https://tech.ryanrobinson.ca/2026/big-tech-alternatives/&quot;&gt;I wrote about the kinds of factors I need to consider in terms of my tech choices&lt;/a&gt;. In this one, I&#39;ll start working through some of the specific decisions as I try to limit my US Big Tech reliance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this stage I have zero connection to Meta or to &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/01/x-blames-users-for-grok-generated-csam-no-fixes-announced/&quot;&gt;X The Everything Including Child Sex Abuse Material App&lt;/a&gt;. I have a little usage of Amazon and Apple, mostly their video streaming services occasionally. I have a lot with Microsoft and with Google. Those last two are the ones where I have some work to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&#39;s a lot of possible conversations within this wider conversation, so I&#39;ll try to summarize the best I can, one category of tech at a time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My one last introductory note: I&#39;m only talking about my personal technology decisions, not the ones for work. Those have different variables to consider and are not entirely my decision. Plus this post is already going to be long enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;email&quot;&gt;Email&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I currently have email with Microsoft. The good news is that I have the old Windows Live Domain offering from when it was free to get email with a custom domain (Google also had this in GSuite). That means I could move the address somewhere else and nobody else should even notice. That part will always be non-negotiable to me: I have to control my address to maintain that freedom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have absolutely zero interest in hosting my own email, though. That is a massive can of worms to keep up with things like Gmail not marking you as spam, as well as ongoing costs to keep a server running with zero downtime or you start missing email. I used to have my email in a paid Microsoft 365 Business account and even that I decided was more hassle than it was worth compared to using the free one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://proton.me/&quot;&gt;Proton&lt;/a&gt; seems like the most viable other option, at $5 CAD per month for the Mail Plus plan (if paying for a year at a time). They&#39;re not Canadian in any way, but at least they&#39;re in the EU with much higher privacy standards. They also aren&#39;t one the tech giants but their reputation puts them in a similar tier for quality. They are also transitioning to be a non-profit and do not have shareholders who can demand sacrificing quality or privacy in exchange for profit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is probably one switch I could make relatively easily on my own. There are a few tradeoffs, including the commitment to the ongoing financial cost. They do have a free version, so that&#39;s a nice way to check it out and learn if there are any major problems it would introduce for me. From what I&#39;ve determined, though, there are a few feature losses I should expect as well, like not including task management and not being able to fully manage a Proton email and an Outlook email in the same app without compromises (e.g. you can add the Proton with IMAP to Outlook but then it doesn&#39;t sync contacts or calendar at all).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proton also offers more intensive plans, with cloud storage, password manager, and VPN. The first two of those I&#39;ll also get into more below. VPN may be nice but I don&#39;t think I really need it often enough for that to be more than a nice bonus. I would consider the unlimited, but only if moving the entire family and that gets into a much harder challenge than moving only myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&#39;s also the related question of which email client I should use, particularly on desktop. If I switched both my individual email and the email shared with my wife to Proton, that&#39;s easy: I could just use the Proton apps for desktop and mobile. But if I&#39;m only moving my own, I&#39;m stuck with two less than ideal options:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have separate apps on both desktop and mobile. I&#39;d get full functionality for each, but with the nuisance of maintaining multiple apps.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use Proton with IMAP on desktop Outlook (or maybe Vivaldi), simplifying to only one app there, but with limited functionality.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;d probably go with the first one realistically, but I&#39;d be a little grumpy about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I would like to start with just doing my email, then decide if it is worth trying to convert everyone later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;cloud-storage-and-document-editing&quot;&gt;Cloud Storage and Document Editing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a Microsoft 365 Family subscription, shared with some family. That gives the Office desktop apps, OneDrive cloud storage, and a few other useful things like some improvements on the aforementioned email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of document editing, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.libreoffice.org/download/download-libreoffice/&quot;&gt;LibreOffice&lt;/a&gt; would almost certainly handle the simple writing and occasional slide presentation or spreadsheet I need. I could drop using the Microsoft 365 desktop apps and replace it quite easily. I&#39;m not fully confident that everybody else using the family plan would accept that, but it probably wouldn&#39;t be that hard for them either if they really wanted to. There may be some more complex business use cases where Microsoft is needed here, but for a lot of us doing personal use, we don&#39;t really need it&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main reason we pay for the Family plan, though, is the cloud storage. It was until recently $110 CAD a year for the Family plan that includes 6 TB total of storage; it&#39;s now jumped to $145. That 6TB is really 1TB per user, but &lt;a href=&quot;https://tech.ryanrobinson.ca/2021/onedrive-family-plan-loophole/&quot;&gt;you can set up sharing so that the files are distributed across the accounts&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have all our photos in OneDrive at full quality, along with many years of documents and website projects and videos and literally everything else. I have a lot of photos with people in them in Google Photos as well, since that makes it easier to find photos by person for things like a digital photo frame or to add a photo to a contact on my phone&#39;s address book, but the main place for absolutely everything at full quality is OneDrive with sync to a computer that has a big enough hard drive to hold it all. So, replacing the cloud storage is the hardest part of phasing out Microsoft 365.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sync.com/&quot;&gt;sync.com&lt;/a&gt; is Canadian and they offer 5TB for $336 per year, more than double the OneDrive price that gives more storage and the other features. Or from the other direction, we could say that the equivalent in price to Microsoft 365 Family would be $6/user/month for the Teams standard that gives 1TB to each user, so at 2 users and 2TB total you&#39;ve already got the same price as for 6 users and 6TB of OneDrive. That&#39;s a big price difference, even if you don&#39;t consider the other things that Microsoft 365 Family offers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proton&#39;s cloud storage offering gives 3TB for the Family of up to 6 users. That&#39;s 3 TB total shared, not 3TB per user. That means half the storage - maybe enough for many families including us, but it is significantly less - and the same user count as Microsoft 365, and comes out at $338 per year. That&#39;s not an apples to apples comparison, though. That includes their email hosting, password manager, and VPN, so it&#39;s certainly a better bargain than sync.com. If all of the family switched all of those components, that&#39;s not unreasonable, as it would save costs on more than just Microsoft 365 Family. But do I really want to switch all of that, including from the password manager where we do at least have a great Canadian company right now (see the next section)? And even if I do, am I really going to convince the rest of the family currently relying on Microsoft 365, like the one who I can&#39;t even get to join Signal?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m not fully closing the door on this one, but the family component does complicate it so I&#39;m not realistically rushing it any time soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;password-manager&quot;&gt;Password Manager&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a rare category where Big Tech doesn&#39;t really have that much dominance. Google, Microsoft, and Apple do have some forms of password manager in their products, but they&#39;re not as robust as the dedicated offerings. Most of the leaders, if you hear knowledgeable people talk about password managers, are independent. Of course, most of those are still US based.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://1password.com/&quot;&gt;1Password&lt;/a&gt; is an exception and a clear winner. It&#39;s independent, Canadian-owned, often at or near the best of the technology, affordably priced, very user friendly which makes it reasonable to share with family, and has a great security track record. Even if I end up switching to Proton for other things and get the package that includes their password manager, I might stick with 1Password anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, in this category I&#39;m already about the best case scenario there is, so let&#39;s move on quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;search&quot;&gt;Search&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://tech.ryanrobinson.ca/2025/types-search/&quot;&gt;I&#39;ve already written a bit about my experiences testing out Kagi&lt;/a&gt;. I like it for good old-fashioned searching for a specific site, and the price is entirely fair, but I realized that&#39;s a relatively small portion of what I use search to do. Bing is still so much better for quick answers like checking the score of the Raptors game. AI chat is much better for working out a complicated coding problem. It&#39;s really not that often that I want to find a specific site result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn&#39;t include DuckDuckGo in those tests. At least for the NBA scores scenario, it seems to be somewhere in between Bing and Kagi. Maybe I should give that a more serious try, but I still most often find myself thinking that it will probably come down to Kagi vs Bing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one lands in the feasible, but maybe not worth it, category.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;browser&quot;&gt;Browser&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of browsers to choose from. Most of them are based on Chromium.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I use &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.firefox.com&quot;&gt;Firefox&lt;/a&gt; on desktop and on my phone, for a bit more privacy and to support a bit of competition in the space. Firefox is working pretty well for me and is the most viable of the &amp;quot;other&amp;quot; players outside of Chrome and Edge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know there are some more obscure ones with even better privacy features. &lt;a href=&quot;https://vivaldi.com&quot;&gt;Vivaldi&lt;/a&gt; may be worth a try and I&#39;ve heard enough good things, but I don&#39;t see this as in the same category of escaping US Big Tech since I&#39;m already on Firefox. I think I&#39;d probably only switch to that if I&#39;m also using its email client, which I would only do if I&#39;m not switching everything to Proton.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;phone-operating-system&quot;&gt;Phone Operating System&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s very hard to use any phone operating system not controlled by either Apple or Google. Of any of the categories here, this is the one most under the firm control of the giants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have considered &lt;a href=&quot;https://grapheneos.org/&quot;&gt;GrapheneOS&lt;/a&gt; on my Pixel phone. From most of what I&#39;ve been able to read, there isn&#39;t a lot of lost functionality, but there is some. This would probably be the biggest privacy win if I pulled it off and was happy about it, but ultimately it is a significant gamble with an extremely important and expensive device. I don&#39;t think this is going to be high on the list of priorities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;computer-operating-system&quot;&gt;Computer Operating System&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our computer uses Windows 11. There&#39;s a lot of enshittification, but at least there&#39;s also a fair bit of openness to shape it how I want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I myself would probably be fine using some version of Linux. My wife would almost certainly have some issues, though. I am not going to buy my own separate computer. I could maybe dual boot, but now we&#39;re getting into that zone of needing to do more maintenance work over time. It does not seem worth it at this stage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;social-media&quot;&gt;Social Media&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven&#39;t used any Meta product in years. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2022/09/myanmar-facebooks-systems-promoted-violence-against-rohingya-meta-owes-reparations-new-report/&quot;&gt;Their involvement in the Rohingya genocide&lt;/a&gt; was my last straw, but there were a lot of things before that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did use Twitter a lot, until the world&#39;s richest crybaby bought it and drove it into the ground to the point that it is now primarily used for extreme right disinformation and for deepfake porn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LinkedIn is the one big corporate one I use, which is in a different category as a professional network. It still has a lot of the problems of the big corporate networks, but I haven&#39;t heard of anything uniquely evil that they&#39;ve done, and the bottom line is that I probably do need it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I use ActivityPub federated options, with Mastodon and Pixelfed below in the footer. I have a Loops account but I&#39;ve been waiting for an app in the Play Store before I really see if I will use it at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also use Bluesky, which is somewhere in the middle of the scale of totally open protocols and greedy corporate influence. I believe some of the developers really do care about building a flexible protocol driven network. They&#39;ve also got VC funding putting pressure on them to turn a profit at some point, and quickly became more centralized than they wanted to be because everyone leaving Twitter had expectations for moderation. I&#39;d like to see them fully complete their mission to be very open, but I&#39;m willing to invest time there even before they do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, nothing more to change here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;private-chat&quot;&gt;Private Chat&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&#39;t use any of the ones with more sketchy security records. I don&#39;t even use WhatsApp that seems to have a better security record than the rest of Meta.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://signal.org/&quot;&gt;Signal&lt;/a&gt; is the gold standard. It is US-based, but at least it is a non-profit and the nature of the end-to-end encryption is that even if an authoritarian government seizes their servers, there is nothing private that is given away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If somebody isn&#39;t on Signal, they get an RCS or at worst SMS message from me, which are less great but at least aren&#39;t controlled by any one company. I do also technically have a personal Teams account, Discord, and Google Meet, but don&#39;t ever use any of those.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Signal is one of these technologies that I am most evangelistic about because I really do think that it&#39;s significantly better and at least as easy as their bigger competitors. It might be the only one of all these discussions where the more ethical option is also at least equal in user experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;video-streaming&quot;&gt;Video Streaming&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;YouTube is the dominant force. I do use it, mostly for movie trailers and sports clips. We even have Premium, mostly for the music (more below) but the ad-free videos are also nice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://nebula.tv/&quot;&gt;Nebula&lt;/a&gt; is a great option. It&#39;s partially owned by the creators who all get paid better per view than they do on YouTube. It&#39;s also pretty cheap even if you only watch one or two regular creators in it. The YouTube Premium subscription costs about half as much in a month as the Nebula subscription does in a year, and at least if you don&#39;t count the music I spend more time on Nebula.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are also fully open options like PeerTube on the ActivityPub protocol (like Mastodon, Pixelfed, Loops). I don&#39;t know anybody who I would follow that uses it, and I am not creating video myself. Video hosting is also a lot more expensive, so this is one of the toughest ones to simply replicate well without Big Tech money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other than the option to cancel Premium, there&#39;s not much room in this one for any changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;music-streaming&quot;&gt;Music Streaming&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have YouTube Premium because that gives ad-free YouTube along with the Music service, and because it&#39;s already there on our Android phones and TV and speakers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I entertained the idea of Tidal, because I remembered it as being artist owned or something. It is now owned by Block (formerly Square), so I don&#39;t think that&#39;s really any better to support than Google. It&#39;s also pretty much the same cost for higher quality music and a more flexible family plan but without the ad-free YouTube videos bonus. About the only way that&#39;s a real improvement is if there was other family who wanted to split the cost. Google&#39;s family plan is tied to the family management of everything else like credit cards for Play Store purchases, so I wouldn&#39;t be able to add extended family to that. Unless that happens, there&#39;s not enough benefit from switching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The closest I can find to a Canadian option is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.music.stingray.com&quot;&gt;Stingray&lt;/a&gt;, which does not seem great. It has no on-demand music, just channels. Honestly that would probably be fine for me, saving a good chunk of money and supporting a Canadian company, but definitely not for my wife who really likes making her own playlists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&#39;t do music streaming nearly as much as my wife does, so a switch here would disproportionately inconvenience her, meaning it is not high on the list of possibilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;podcasts&quot;&gt;Podcasts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this one, I really just want to say: use something that supports any RSS feed. Don&#39;t use those like Spotify that have their own shows locked down to only play in their apps, undermining the entire concept of the open protocol podcast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I personally have been using &lt;a href=&quot;https://pocketcasts.com/&quot;&gt;Pocket Casts&lt;/a&gt; for years and have always been happy with it. They&#39;re owned by Automattic, owner of WordPress, and are US based but at least fairly open and not part of one of the giants. It&#39;s been a long time since I experimented with anything else, but that&#39;s because Pocket Casts continues to do everything I want it to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;movies&quot;&gt;Movies&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For most people now, watching movies means streaming services. I have some of those, but I definitely don&#39;t think they&#39;re ideal for a lot of the same reasons that I&#39;ve been talking about in these posts: constantly increasing costs, too much content to ever consume anyway, and being locked in to paying some US tech giant money every month just to watch your favourite movies. Sometimes you have no choice but streaming to watch something, as they don&#39;t even offer any other mode of consumption anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love physical media. I&#39;ve got a good quality 4K Blu-ray player. Watching a 4K disc, or even a regular Blu-ray disc with the upscaling, gives you higher quality than streaming, although that gap has closed on a lot of platforms if your Internet can handle it. Physical media also means you own once you pay for it once, not a monthly fee for a service which may not even keep that movie on it forever. I also like being able to look at the shelves. They&#39;re collector items for me at this point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is also the in-between option of the digital purchases or rentals from the Big Tech stores: Google, Amazon, Apple, and formerly Microsoft (they won&#39;t sell anything new but you can still watch if you bought anything before). Referring to a &amp;quot;purchase&amp;quot; on these is misleading, as what you are really purchasing is an indefinite license for as long as the store continues to operate. There&#39;s a lot to be said for the convenience, and there can be good sale prices, but ultimately you&#39;re handing money to Big Tech again to maybe continue to have access as long as you don&#39;t leave their platform. When Movies Anywhere was first announced, I was optimistic that would enable the ease of buying movies digitally but also still freedom to move between platforms. Unfortunately, that never expanded beyond the US or to include some of the smaller distributors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;tv-operating-system&quot;&gt;TV Operating System&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any TV that has apps is going to be doing a ridiculous amount of data mining. It is still possible to buy TVs without an Internet connection, but of course that means you don&#39;t have easy access to the apps you want, so then you buy the extra box that does all the data mining and is less friendly integration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anything with Roku the worst for data collection and ads, while having significantly worse app support in Canada and mostly being only on low to mid-range TVs. They get some credit for not being owned by one of the giants, but that&#39;s it. Samsung doesn&#39;t support Dolby Vision at all, so I ruled them out, too. We considered the higher end of the TCL mini-LED to save a little money, but from everything I read, OLED makes more sense in a basement because of the deeper blacks and would be worth the extra (mini-LED is great in more sunny spaces, though). LG could have worked with their revamped webOS system on it, and all indications are that they are great as well, but ultimately we decided that if we&#39;re going to have some massive data mining anyway, we may as well have the best apps and the most integration to all our other Google things and go with a Sony OLED that has Google TV on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, in terms of this one, the only real consideration is whether I should make more effort to block the data mining. I could set up &lt;a href=&quot;https://pi-hole.net/&quot;&gt;a Pi Hole&lt;/a&gt;. I believe that&#39;s relatively cheap and simple to set up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;smart-home&quot;&gt;Smart Home&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We bought a house not long after smart home devices started becoming a thing. We immediately needed a new thermostat, so we got an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ecobee.com&quot;&gt;ecobee&lt;/a&gt;, a Canadian company with a great reputation so far. That continues to be my favourite smart home thing. We added some &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.philips-hue.com/en-ca&quot;&gt;Hue bulbs&lt;/a&gt;, which are nice but expensive and not as easy to use as I wish they were. We have tried some smart plugs, including the miserable to set up Belkin Wemo that are now no longer supported, which are not really that much more useful than having a power bar with a timer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The closest thing we have to a hub for managing all of this is Google Home, which has been adequate for my minimal attempts to use it. There are some little things like having a &amp;quot;good morning&amp;quot; routine which are nice. But it&#39;s not that powerful, and obviously we are sending all the data off to Google for every trivial request, which is less than ideal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would like to migrate to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.home-assistant.io/&quot;&gt;Home Assistant&lt;/a&gt;. It&#39;s not that expensive to get some hardware and then it all runs locally. It&#39;s all open source, with a strong community so even if the organization providing some oversight fails, the technology would likely survive. From what I&#39;ve heard, it&#39;s a bit of a pain to set up, but once it is, there isn&#39;t that much extra maintenance to keep it going. This seems like the kind of project I might actually enjoy playing with, though, and it doesn&#39;t have much risk of breaking anything I really care about the way that GrapheneOS feels like such a risk to try on my phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;git-repository&quot;&gt;Git Repository&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I use &lt;a href=&quot;https://about.gitlab.com/&quot;&gt;GitLab&lt;/a&gt; at work, on a hosted instance. Because of that, certain code I write personally I also put in &lt;a href=&quot;https://gitlab.com/ryan-l-robinson&quot;&gt;my own GitLab.com account&lt;/a&gt;, because that&#39;s where I know my way around the CI/CD functionality already.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other than that, I currently have the rest of my personal code in &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ryan-l-robinson&quot;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;, including this website. That&#39;s owned by Microsoft, but operated mostly independently. I don&#39;t have any real problems with GitHub. I would definitely need to keep a GitHub account either way, as it is how to interact with a lot of other projects. But ultimately, yeah, it&#39;s a US Big Tech, and I&#39;d rather something else if I could.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are other options, like the Canadian &lt;a href=&quot;https://about.worktree.ca/&quot;&gt;Worktree&lt;/a&gt; and the European non-profit &lt;a href=&quot;https://codeberg.org/&quot;&gt;Codeberg&lt;/a&gt;. Worktree gets an edge as Canadian. Codeberg gets an edge as non-profit and more established. I&#39;m going to try Worktree first because it is nice to see a new Canadian company trying to do this. We&#39;ll see how it goes from there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This could still go a few different directions. At minimum, some things will be in GitLab. Some other things will probably be in Worktree and/or Codeberg and/or GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;ai-chat&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;AI&amp;quot; Chat&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is still a fairly open area, although it isn&#39;t a coincidence that a lot of the most popular ones are also associated with the Big Tech companies working with massive sets of data. OpenAI and Anthropic are two that are big now and came out of nowhere as technically independent, but they get a lot of their funding and cloud services from Microsoft and Amazon respectively, so they aren&#39;t quite Big Tech but they are Big Tech adjacent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are models that can be run locally, but you need a computer with enough power and some technical expertise. Considering I essentially only use it for code, my ideal probably really is to have a model that is highly specialized for Drupal development and run it locally. That would completely keep the big tech companies out, with no subscription fees and no data being sent off to them. I haven&#39;t come across anything that is even close to ready for that yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, there are some smaller companies that seem to have more ethical standards, like &lt;a href=&quot;https://nousresearch.com/&quot;&gt;Nous Research&lt;/a&gt;. I have not tried them at this point. If I do get to a point where I feel like I need to pay a US company, I might on principle try that first and see if it can be maybe not as good but at least good enough. Most likely, I won&#39;t be personally paying for any AI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusions&quot;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what of those are the most reasonable? I think I&#39;ve mostly come down to these ones that I can mostly do without inconveniencing anyone else:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Move code repositories to WorkTree and/or Codeberg and limit GitHub&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set up Home Assistant and phase out Google Home&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Move email to Proton instead of Microsoft&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set up a Pi Hole for network-wide ad blocking including the smart TV&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Switch to Kagi for search instead of Bing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does that leave me? For Microsoft, that would get me down to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Windows&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;LinkedIn&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Xbox&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;OneDrive&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And for Google, I&#39;d still have:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Android on my phone&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Android on the TV (but somewhat limited in its data collection with the raspberry pi)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Photos mostly to populate the photo frame&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;some YouTube, including Music&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;occasional movie rentals or purchases&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&#39;s still a fair bit, and there might be a second wave of more dramatic changes I could make after this first group to cut it down even more, but I do think even if I only pull off those 5 changes that is a worthwhile effort.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Distancing from US Big Tech</title>
    <link href="https://tech.ryanrobinson.ca/2026/big-tech-alternatives/" />
    <updated>2026-01-13T18:58:09Z</updated>
    <id>https://tech.ryanrobinson.ca/2026/big-tech-alternatives/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are plenty of good reasons why you should limit your reliance on Big Tech, by which for the English speaking world I primarily mean Meta (Facebook), Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet (Google), and Apple. China in particular does have its own set of tech giants and different socio-political contexts, and I am not pretending to know enough to be talking about them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this post I will touch on some of the good reasons why I am trying to be more intentional about trying to reduce my reliance on those big US tech companies. I will follow up with at least one more post wrestling through specific decisions for various categories of software. As I get into those decisions, I think it will become clear how a lot of these factors sometimes come into conflict with each other. Sometimes achieving a gain in one area means a loss in another and you have to decide which one is more importantly this time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that&#39;s enough introduction. Here are some of the general ways of thinking for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;enshittification&quot;&gt;Enshittification&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enshittification&quot;&gt;the enshittification trap&lt;/a&gt;: the more you rely on a closed system, the more trapped you become. They may drastically raise costs, but you don&#39;t have a choice because now you rely on it. They may make it even more closed, but since you don&#39;t really have any better options you have to accept it. They may shove in even more ads. They may start tracking even more about you. When you&#39;re trapped, they can make the product infinitely worse in order to extract just a little more profit and it is very hard to get out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, I want to give priority to companies that have competition and that have some degree of openness like being able to migrate away to another service without high switching costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;wealth-inequality&quot;&gt;Wealth Inequality&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&#39;s the wealth inequality: do I really want to keep shoving more and more money at the same handful of executives of giant companies? What if we tried to share the love a little to some smaller companies or in support of open source projects?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My general philosophy is that there is some healthy balance. We don&#39;t want 10,000 competing email providers. That&#39;s impossible to settle on standards and they will probably largely be bad because of it. But we don&#39;t want to get down to only 5 providers either, because then they are a cartel with complete control of an essential method of communication. We need just enough consolidation to be able to settle on protocols and standards and push innovation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to give priority to the non-profits, or even to open source developers doing good work largely without thanks, then the smaller or medium companies who are trying to compete against the giants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;data-privacy-and-sovereignty&quot;&gt;Data Privacy and Sovereignty&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These Big Tech companies are consolidating a massive amount of information about you and everything you have ever done on the Internet in one place. It is vulnerable to hackers, although I do think that risk is often offset by how these Big Tech companies also often have the best funded security teams to combat them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other risk that is becoming more obvious, though, especially to those of us outside the United States, is that governments can demand that data. Some of the tech companies will hold the line more than others, only giving up that data when there is a valid search warrant, but others will immediately hand it over without a second thought. If the companies have the data, authoritarian governments can demand it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s also of course possible that the companies will abuse the data themselves, turning their power against the users who empowered them in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to give priority to companies/non-profits/projects that don&#39;t store data in the first place, if possible. Failing that, I would rather give data to Canadian companies, followed by European ones, before American ones. There may be some companies from other places like China and Japan, but I&#39;m not sure any that come into play for these specific decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;user-friendliness-accessibility-and-integrations&quot;&gt;User Friendliness, Accessibility, and Integrations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Big Tech products are often easier to use. They prioritize getting users locked in before they start the enshittification. This is, unfortunately, compared to a lot of open source projects that are made by computer nerds for computer nerds and thus are not very friendly for everyone else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accessibility for those with disabilities can also often be a big failure for these small projects, as they see it as something to get around to later. At least the big companies have some baseline of legal compliance they have to meet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are often benefits to the integration potential that comes with Big Tech. Sometimes smaller or open source projects can achieve this through open protocols or partnerships rather than market dominance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&#39;s a certain amount of unfriendliness that I can handle as a tech person myself, but especially if my choice of technology is going to impact others in my life, I do need to give some priority to lowering the amount of user friction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;innovation&quot;&gt;Innovation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Big Tech may be often at the cutting edge with terrible enshittifying ideas, but they are also often at the edge of new and useful ideas too, before a lot of that does trickle out elsewhere. Sometimes it simply comes down to that none of the more ethical options are offering a feature that I really would benefit from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;security&quot;&gt;Security&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Security is still really important, albeit to varying levels depending on the usage and the kind of data being used. Big Tech often does security better. A lot of the time it is the small and medium companies who are failing, because they don&#39;t have the budgets and don&#39;t have enough attention on them to be really held accountable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;monetary-costs&quot;&gt;Monetary Costs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It shouldn&#39;t be the number one priority, but the financial cost has to be on the list. It is impossible to pay for everything all the time. I will need to accept the free versions of some things, or giving up data instead, or opting out of that category entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I need to think about monetary cost. Big Tech is often free or cheap on the surface, because they make their money from the data instead. If I want privacy, I probably have to pay for it, whether that&#39;s with a one-time cost to buy hardware or software, or a subscription fee, or at the very least considerations to give some donations to open source maintainers. Most of us can&#39;t afford to pay for all of the things, but I might be able to pay for some more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That does mean that practically, yes, cheaper is usually better than more expensive, as long as it is still a sustainable business model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;effort-to-switch&quot;&gt;Effort to Switch&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I need to think about how long it will take me to migrate. Is it a quick process, a few hours on a weekend, or is a long project that is going to stop me from other things to do with my time? There&#39;s only so much time to go around, so I do need to prioritize the ones that I think I can actually finish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;effort-to-maintain&quot;&gt;Effort to Maintain&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, how much friction is it going to add to my life on an ongoing basis after that? I might do the one-time long migration project, but I get a lot more cautious once I know that it is going to require an extra hour of my life every week to maintain it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;network-effects&quot;&gt;Network Effects&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest variable of all, though, is how my decision might impact others. It&#39;s one thing to declare that I will only communicate by Signal from now on. That&#39;s fine for me, but if others are not willing to make the same change no matter how effectively I explain all the ethical obligations, I&#39;ve just said that I will never communicate with them again. What do I do: cut them off? Migrate as many people as I can but accept still using something else like WhatsApp for the rest? Or give up because I don&#39;t want to juggle multiple messaging apps and who are in each one, settling for using the most popular one no matter how evil it is? Some of these choices are a little bit in a vacuum with the decisions only impacting myself, but most of them will involve others one way or another.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Database Lifecycle</title>
    <link href="https://tech.ryanrobinson.ca/2026/drupal-db-lifecycle/" />
    <updated>2026-01-13T17:11:16Z</updated>
    <id>https://tech.ryanrobinson.ca/2026/drupal-db-lifecycle/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This series has now covered all the core functionality of having a local development environment and deploying updates, and most elements of testing (phpunit regression tests is coming later, as there are some things I have not quite solved in the CI/CD part yet).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this post, I will get into a database lifecycle strategy, used to help ensure that my developer environment, dev server, and staging server are roughly reflecting realistic content, even if not exactly up-to-date. This is done with a series of the &amp;quot;single use&amp;quot; jobs that I mentioned in &lt;a href=&quot;https://tech.ryanrobinson.ca/2025/devenv-deploy-update-jobs/&quot;&gt;the deployment post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike most else from this series, none of this is in my example Drupal developer environment project, since I don&#39;t have actual servers personally to test any of it against. I am generalizing from my work context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;dump-a-production-database&quot;&gt;Dump a (Production) Database&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first step is to dump the production database, so that I will have it ready to copy to the other environments. In the docker-compose file of the project, it includes this service:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-yml&quot; tabindex=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-yml&quot;&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;db_dump&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;image&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; $&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;CI_REGISTRY_IMAGE&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;YOUR REPO HERE&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;/web&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;$&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;CI_COMMIT_REF_NAME&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;main&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;command&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; /opt/drupal/scripts/dump&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;db.sh
    &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;environment&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token important&quot;&gt;*mysql&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token important&quot;&gt;*config-split&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token important&quot;&gt;*deploy-env&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;volumes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; private&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;/opt/drupal/private
      &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; public&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;/opt/drupal/web/sites/default/files
      &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; backups&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;/opt/drupal/backups
    &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;deploy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;mode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; replicated
      &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;replicas&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;restart_policy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;condition&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; on&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;failure
        &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;max_attempts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This tells it to run once, using the main project image going through the script dump-db, and then stop. There are the usual two volumes for Drupal private and public files, plus one more for the backup that is going to be generated. This is mapped elsewhere to be a network file share, which will be necessary for the other servers to also be able to grab it easily when it comes time to import it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The script that it runs is simple:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-bash&quot; tabindex=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token shebang important&quot;&gt;#!/bin/bash&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token builtin class-name&quot;&gt;source&lt;/span&gt; /opt/drupal/scripts/settings-file.sh

drush sql:dump --result-file&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;/opt/drupal/backups/&lt;span class=&quot;token variable&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token variable&quot;&gt;$(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;date&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&#39;+%Y-%m-%d_%H-%M-%S&#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token variable&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;_prod.sql&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;sleep&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;30&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The settings-file I have already covered elsewhere; that is used for importing the database connection that varies by environment. Otherwise, it&#39;s making use of a drush command to dump a file to backups using today&#39;s date to help sort it and differentiate it from previous backups. The 30 second sleep is to make sure this script runs long enough to report back to the single-use job CI/CD script.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, to run that, the project&#39;s CI/CD job might look like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-yml&quot; tabindex=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-yml&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;prod_db_dump&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;stage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; deploy
  &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;allow_failure&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token boolean important&quot;&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;extends&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; .docker_single_use
  &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;environment&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; Production
  &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;variables&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;STACK_NAME&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; drupal
    &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;SERVICE_NAME&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; db_dump
  &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;environment&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; Production
  &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;tags&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; prod
  &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;only&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;refs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; main
  &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;when&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; manual&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;download-the-file-for-local&quot;&gt;Download the File for Local&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another job will show you the newest database backup file from the shared storage, allowing you to download it as an artifact. This lets you keep it as a backup in case anything goes wrong, like just before a deployment, as well as to update the content on the local developer environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m not going to repeat the docker-compose and the GitLab CI, since they&#39;re basically the same, but here&#39;s the script:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-bash&quot; tabindex=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token shebang important&quot;&gt;#!/bin/bash&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token assign-left variable&quot;&gt;BACKUP_DIR&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;span class=&quot;token variable&quot;&gt;$1&lt;/span&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token assign-left variable&quot;&gt;BACKUP_FILE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;span class=&quot;token variable&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token variable&quot;&gt;$(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;ls&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token parameter variable&quot;&gt;-1r&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;span class=&quot;token variable&quot;&gt;${BACKUP_DIR}&lt;/span&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;head&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token parameter variable&quot;&gt;-n&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token variable&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token assign-left variable&quot;&gt;BACKUP_FILE_FULL_PATH&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;span class=&quot;token variable&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token variable&quot;&gt;$(&lt;/span&gt;readlink &lt;span class=&quot;token parameter variable&quot;&gt;-f&lt;/span&gt; $&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;BACKUP_DIR&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;/$&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;BACKUP_FILE&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token variable&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token assign-left variable&quot;&gt;ARTIFACT_DIR&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;span class=&quot;token variable&quot;&gt;$2&lt;/span&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token builtin class-name&quot;&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;Exporting &lt;span class=&quot;token variable&quot;&gt;${BACKUP_FILE_FULL_PATH}&lt;/span&gt; as an artifact...&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;cp&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token parameter variable&quot;&gt;-v&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;span class=&quot;token variable&quot;&gt;${BACKUP_FILE_FULL_PATH}&lt;/span&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;span class=&quot;token variable&quot;&gt;${ARTIFACT_DIR}&lt;/span&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;sleep&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;30&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;import-to-dev-or-staging&quot;&gt;Import to Dev or Staging&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, another job with a similar setup will allow running on dev or staging to import that database there. Again I&#39;ll share just the script:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-bash&quot; tabindex=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token shebang important&quot;&gt;#!/bin/bash&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token builtin class-name&quot;&gt;source&lt;/span&gt; /opt/drupal/scripts/settings-file.sh

&lt;span class=&quot;token assign-left variable&quot;&gt;BACKUP_FILE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;/opt/drupal/backups/&lt;span class=&quot;token variable&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token variable&quot;&gt;$(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;ls&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token parameter variable&quot;&gt;-1r&lt;/span&gt; /opt/drupal/backups &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;head&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token parameter variable&quot;&gt;-n&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token variable&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;span class=&quot;token variable&quot;&gt;${BACKUP_FILE}&lt;/span&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;then&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token builtin class-name&quot;&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;No backups found&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token builtin class-name&quot;&gt;exit&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;else&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token builtin class-name&quot;&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;Applying SQL from &lt;span class=&quot;token variable&quot;&gt;${BACKUP_FILE}&lt;/span&gt;...&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;token variable&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token variable&quot;&gt;$(&lt;/span&gt;drush sql:connect&lt;span class=&quot;token variable&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token variable&quot;&gt;${BACKUP_FILE}&lt;/span&gt;

    drush cr

    &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;# Update database if files are now ahead of backup.&lt;/span&gt;
    drush updb &lt;span class=&quot;token parameter variable&quot;&gt;-y&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;# Update config twice to ensure any config_split differences&lt;/span&gt;
    drush config-import &lt;span class=&quot;token parameter variable&quot;&gt;-y&lt;/span&gt;
    drush config-import &lt;span class=&quot;token parameter variable&quot;&gt;-y&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;# Activate and set the distinct local password on the admin user.&lt;/span&gt;
    drush user:unblock &lt;span class=&quot;token variable&quot;&gt;$DRUPAL_USER_NAME&lt;/span&gt;
    drush upwd &lt;span class=&quot;token variable&quot;&gt;$DRUPAL_USER_NAME&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token variable&quot;&gt;$DRUPAL_USER_PASSWORD&lt;/span&gt;

    drush cr
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;fi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This imports the latest backup file that was found. It then does a few more things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;clears caches&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;completes any due database updates, which could be necessary if the code for dev/staging is already ahead of the backup&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;imports configuration twice (to account for config_split differences between environments), again to include if the code/config is already ahead of the backup on these other environments&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;unblocks the Drupal super-admin that can be used on dev or staging unlike production&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;changes the password on that user to the environment-specific one that is stored in GitLab&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;clears caches again at the end&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    <title>Pa11y and Pa11y-CI Accessibility</title>
    <link href="https://tech.ryanrobinson.ca/2026/pa11y-ci/" />
    <updated>2026-01-13T16:25:16Z</updated>
    <id>https://tech.ryanrobinson.ca/2026/pa11y-ci/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This series has now covered all the core functionality of having a local development environment and deploying updates. The majority of what&#39;s left has to do with automated testing, including this one using &lt;a href=&quot;https://pa11y.org/&quot;&gt;Pa11y and Pa11y-CI&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pa11y and Pa11y-CI, as the names suggest, are very similar with the same kinds of tests it can run, but with a few differences in exactly which features are available. The biggest one of interest to me is that Pa11y-CI includes an extremely simple command out of the box to check the accessibility of all pages in a sitemap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One notable difference compared to &lt;a href=&quot;https://tech.ryanrobinson.ca/2026/playwright-axe-tests/&quot;&gt;the Playwright tests from the last post&lt;/a&gt; is that there are no other interactions or mock devices involved here. Whereas with Playwright I could say things like &amp;quot;using an iPhone X in dark mode, click on this button and then check the accessibility of the page after&amp;quot; here it is much more simply scanning every page as they are initially loaded. That gives it an advantage in ease of use, but doesn&#39;t cover every scenario you may want to test.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;building-a-dedicated-testing-image&quot;&gt;Building A Dedicated Testing Image&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://gitlab.com/ryan-l-robinson/pa11y-Docker-GitLab&quot;&gt;A dedicated pa11y testing image is available in my GitLab&lt;/a&gt;. That can be used for running tests like one against the sitemap, which will work externally as long as the site you&#39;re trying to test is publicly accessible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Dockerfile installs some needed packages, sets up the necessary file structure, and installs pa11y-ci including with the HTML report that is the most friendly to read for a large site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As always in this Drupal Docker series, the gitlab-ci job then extends &lt;a href=&quot;https://tech.ryanrobinson.ca/2025/devenv-build-image-ci/&quot;&gt;my general purpose Docker build job that I&#39;ve already gotten into&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also has a configuration file that defines how pa11y-ci should run, including that it will report to both the command line and to the HTML reporter. The most important here is the --no-sandbox option. None of the tests will run without that.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;frame-title&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;&quot;level&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;warning&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;running-the-tests&quot;&gt;Running the Tests&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I want a specific project to be able to run tests, the CI job in that project would look like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-yml&quot; tabindex=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-yml&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;# Includes general CI jobs #&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;include&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;project&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;ryan-l-robinson/gitlab-ci&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;ref&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; main
    &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;file&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; test.yml

&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;### Checks a sitemap using Pa11y. ###&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;pa11y_test&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;extends&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; .pa11y_test
  &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;stage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; content_test
  &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;environment&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; Production
  &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;variables&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;SITEMAP_URL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; https&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;//tech.ryanrobinson.ca/sitemap.xml
  &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;only&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;refs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; main&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is extending my general purpose job which uses the image I&#39;ve previously built, checking all the pages of a sitemap, and keeping the report for 5 months:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-yml&quot; tabindex=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-yml&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;## Runs accessibility sitemap tests using pa11y ##&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;.pa11y_test&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;stage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; test
  &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;image&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; registry.gitlab.com/ryan&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;l&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;robinson/pa11y&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;docker&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;gitlab/pa11y
  &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;variables&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;SITEMAP_URL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;script&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;# Use pa11y-ci&#39;s built-in function for scanning from a sitemap. #&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; pa11y&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;ci &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;sitemap $SITEMAP_URL &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;config /opt/pa11y/config.json
  &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;# Show as warning but don&#39;t stop execution of later jobs if failure. #&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;allow_failure&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token boolean important&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;# Save the reports for 5 months, past our next release. #&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;artifacts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;when&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; always
    &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;paths&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; pa11y&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;ci&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;report
    &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;expire_in&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; 5 months&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;running-tests-locally&quot;&gt;Running Tests Locally&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;installation-requirements&quot;&gt;Installation Requirements&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pa11y packages are being added in &lt;a href=&quot;https://tech.ryanrobinson.ca/2025/devenv-postcreate/&quot;&gt;the postCreateCommand discussed in a previous post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;running-tests&quot;&gt;Running Tests&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These tests can only be run from the command line, like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-bash&quot; tabindex=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;pa11y&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or using pa11y-ci to check an entire sitemap:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-bash&quot; tabindex=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;pa11y-ci &lt;span class=&quot;token parameter variable&quot;&gt;--sitemap&lt;/span&gt; https://tech.ryanrobinson.ca&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;html-reporter&quot;&gt;HTML Reporter&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pa11y can dump the results into reports in a few different formats, including HTML. This then allows browsing the results one at a time in a very easy to read format. Some of the other formats like a JSON file aren&#39;t bad if there are few results, but get hard to work with on larger sites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;configuration&quot;&gt;Configuration&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike Playwright, there are no tests to write yourself here, but you may need to adjust some of the configuration files. Pa11y and Pa11y-ci have different files. I&#39;m not going to pretend to know why they have slightly different files, but pa11y defaults to a configuration file position of pa11y.json, and pa11y-ci defaults to .pa11yci.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my case, here&#39;s my pa11y.json:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-json&quot; tabindex=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-json&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;&quot;chromeLaunchConfig&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;&quot;args&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;--no-sandbox&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;--ignore-certificate-errors&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;--allow-insecure-localhost&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;&quot;ignoreHTTPSErrors&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token boolean&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;&quot;defaults&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;&quot;timeout&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;120000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;&quot;reporters&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;cli&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;pa11y-ci-reporter-html&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;&quot;runners&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;axe&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;htmlcs&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;&quot;ignore&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;frame-tested&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;frame-title&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;&quot;level&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;warning&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And here&#39;s my .pa11yci:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-json&quot; tabindex=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-json&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

    <title>Playwright Testing</title>

    <id>https://tech.ryanrobinson.ca/2026/playwright-axe-tests/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This series has now covered all the core functionality of having a local development environment and deploying updates. The majority of what&#39;s left has to do with automated testing, including this one using Playwright.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://playwright.dev/&quot;&gt;Playwright&lt;/a&gt; is a tool that can simulate browser activity and then assert that things are how you think they should be. That includes interactions, like expanding a menu or clicking on a button. It also includes the ability to emulate multiple browsers and operating systems and screen sizes and dark or light mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;testing-in-gitlab-ci-cd&quot;&gt;Testing in GitLab CI/CD&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;testing-image&quot;&gt;Testing Image&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have &lt;a href=&quot;https://gitlab.com/ryan-l-robinson/playwright-axe-Docker-GitLab&quot;&gt;a project in my GitLab&lt;/a&gt; that creates a Dockerfile which can be used to run tests, storing that container in the GitLab container registry where other projects can use it to run tests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Dockerfile is straightforward, using a general image from Microsoft and making a few small tweaks from there to be able to run my specific tests:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-Dockerfile&quot; tabindex=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-Dockerfile&quot;&gt;# Get the latest version of Playwright
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/playwright:v1.54.2-noble

# Copy playwright files, including tests
RUN mkdir /opt/playwright
WORKDIR /opt/playwright
COPY / /opt/playwright/

# Install required plugins
RUN npm install -g playwright
RUN npm i -D @playwright/test @axe-core/playwright fsp-xml-parser&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the .gitlab-ci for that project is a simple job extending &lt;a href=&quot;https://tech.ryanrobinson.ca/2025/devenv-build-image-ci/&quot;&gt;the build job&lt;/a&gt; I&#39;ve noted previously in order to build that image and store it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;configuration-file&quot;&gt;Configuration File&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another file configures what tests should run and using which mock devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-ts&quot; tabindex=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ts&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; defineConfig&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; devices &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&#39;@playwright/test&#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;defineConfig&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is giving me:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A timeout of 1 minute per action.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A mix of devices, giving me Firefox on a desktop computer, Safari on a newer iPhone in light mode, and Chrome on an older Android in dark mode. Between them I&#39;ve got the major browser options, light and dark mode, and a bit of range in screen size.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Where to find the files, under the tests directory. I currently have a slightly complicated few layers so that some tests only run in certain combinations of local or CI/CD and using the desktop or the mobile mock devices, and those tests can be defined centrally for all sites (a generic sitemap scan) or on a per-project basis. I might simplify this because I haven&#39;t really needed as much variation as I thought I did.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;running-the-tests-in-ci-cd&quot;&gt;Running the Tests in CI/CD&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I want a specific project to be able to run tests, the CI job in that project would look like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-yml&quot; tabindex=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-yml&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;# Includes general CI jobs #&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;running-tests-locally&quot;&gt;Running Tests Locally&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;installation-requirements&quot;&gt;Installation Requirements&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two files which I&#39;ve already touched on in this series:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In &lt;a href=&quot;https://tech.ryanrobinson.ca/2025/devenv-devcontainer/&quot;&gt;the devcontainer.json&lt;/a&gt;, there is a line in the list of extensions to include ms-playwright.playwright, the official Microsoft Playwright extension for VS Code.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In &lt;a href=&quot;https://tech.ryanrobinson.ca/2025/devenv-postcreate/&quot;&gt;the postCreateCommand script&lt;/a&gt; that runs after building the developer environment for the first time, there are some lines to install the packages using npm that allow the tests to run.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other one is the configuration file for these tests, which is basically the same as the one for the CI/CD version above except a longer timeout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;using-tests-explorer-in-vs-code&quot;&gt;Using Tests Explorer in VS Code&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These tests, like many others, are integrated within the Tests Explorer functionality of VS Code. You can use that to see all tests and their status at a glance, and run more. You can also debug your tests from there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://tech.ryanrobinson.ca/2026/playwright-axe-tests/M2ZNnG1bUc-425.avif 425w&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://tech.ryanrobinson.ca/2026/playwright-axe-tests/M2ZNnG1bUc-425.webp 425w&quot;&gt;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; src=&quot;https://tech.ryanrobinson.ca/2026/playwright-axe-tests/M2ZNnG1bUc-425.png&quot; alt=&quot;&amp;quot;The Tests Explorer in VS Code. The Playwright section is expanded with multiple tests or directories of tests. One test has been run, with a green checkmark indicating it passed.&amp;quot;&quot; width=&quot;425&quot; height=&quot;445&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a handful of other options as part of the Playwright VS Code extension, including being able to view the tests as they run popping up in a browser. This can be useful in some cases. I have previously had this working in some contexts, but it does not currently work in the Drupal Docker environment that this series has been building.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tests can also be run from the command line, but if there are a lot of tests I do find that can get a little more overwhelming to review them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;writing-tests&quot;&gt;Writing Tests&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That leaves the most important part: the tests themselves. These can be written in TypeScript or vanilla JavaScript. Neither of those are my specialty, but I have slowly been getting more comfortable with it. Here is a simple example test in TypeScript that confirms accessibility of a few interactions with a search box, and ensures that these hits will not get logged to Google Analytics and skew the results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-ts&quot; tabindex=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ts&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// Include general Playwright testing and the Axe-core accessibility testing library.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; test&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; expect &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;require&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&#39;@playwright/test&#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; AxeBuilder &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;require&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&#39;@axe-core/playwright&#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;default&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// Grab the site&#39;s base URL and Google Analytics tag from an environment variable.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;baseURL &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;===&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;undefined&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; baseURL &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; process&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;env&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token constant&quot;&gt;BASE_URL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;ga_tag &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;===&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;undefined&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

    <title>Eleventy Theme Updated</title>
    <link href="https://tech.ryanrobinson.ca/2026/11ty-theme-update/" />
    <updated>2026-01-06T16:40:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://tech.ryanrobinson.ca/2026/11ty-theme-update/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I also redid &lt;a href=&quot;https://ryanrobinson.ca&quot;&gt;the ryanrobinson.ca landing page&lt;/a&gt; with some similar design, but I&#39;m not going to talk about that any more here - that&#39;s plain HTML and CSS and the only hard decisions was in what content I should put there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-code-structure&quot;&gt;The Code Structure&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this post, I&#39;m just going to note how the code is structured.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The code is split into two:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The theme that is shared between the two sites, housed at &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ryan-l-robinson/11ty-theme&quot;&gt;the 11ty-theme project in my GitHub&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ryan-l-robinson/tech.ryanrobinson.ca&quot;&gt;individual site&#39;s project&lt;/a&gt;, which sets a lot of site configuration as well as contains all the post content.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The theme is not fully abstracted. There are some things in there which are uniquely intended for me, like all the social media links in the footer, but they are the same for the two sites so it didn&#39;t seem worth the effort to make the theme more abstract and then have to define all the links on each site separately. I could still do that if I learned that somebody else really wanted to use that theme, but that isn&#39;t likely so I can keep it more efficient and easier to maintain this way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the rest of this series, I&#39;ll look at some of the more confusing parts: pages listing posts by tag and by year, nested pagination, sidebar flexibility, tag and series descriptions, search, and maybe some more if I think of it later.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>H5P Views Drupal Module</title>
    <link href="https://tech.ryanrobinson.ca/2026/h5p-views/" />
    <updated>2026-01-06T14:54:16Z</updated>
    <id>https://tech.ryanrobinson.ca/2026/h5p-views/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-problem&quot;&gt;The Problem&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;H5P is a tool that is used to help build interactive content in education settings. It has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.drupal.org/project/h5p&quot;&gt;a Drupal module&lt;/a&gt; so that you can host your own interactive objects on a Drupal site. Those interactive objects can be of &lt;a href=&quot;https://h5p.org/content-types-and-applications&quot;&gt;a variety of H5P library types&lt;/a&gt; and then can be embedded elsewhere like on other websites or inside a Learning Management System implementation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is not always the best maintained module, though, and doesn&#39;t have some things that I wanted. One of those missing features is exposing the H5P library type within views, to display as well as to filter or sort by them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-solution&quot;&gt;The Solution&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To help meet that need, I developed a custom module. &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ryan-l-robinson/drupal-module-h5p-views&quot;&gt;It is available on my GitHub&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two main components for this to work:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-hooks-to-expose-the-data&quot;&gt;The Hooks to Expose the Data&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I am now working primarily with Drupal 11.3, I will use &lt;a href=&quot;https://attia-it.com/blog/hooks-implementation-drupal-11-new-oop-approach&quot;&gt;the new OOP hook implementation system&lt;/a&gt;, putting a file under src/Hook/H5pViewsHooks.php:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-php&quot; tabindex=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-php&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token php language-php&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token delimiter important&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;?php&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;namespace&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token package&quot;&gt;Drupal&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&#92;&lt;/span&gt;h5p_views&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&#92;&lt;/span&gt;Hook&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;use&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token package&quot;&gt;Drupal&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&#92;&lt;/span&gt;Core&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&#92;&lt;/span&gt;Hook&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&#92;&lt;/span&gt;Attribute&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&#92;&lt;/span&gt;Hook&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;use&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token package&quot;&gt;Drupal&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&#92;&lt;/span&gt;Core&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&#92;&lt;/span&gt;StringTranslation&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&#92;&lt;/span&gt;StringTranslationTrait&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;/**
 * Implements hooks for H5P Views module.
 */&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token class-name-definition class-name&quot;&gt;H5pViewsHooks&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;/**
   * Adds fields for views.
   */&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token attribute&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token delimiter punctuation&quot;&gt;#[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attribute-content&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attribute-class-name class-name&quot;&gt;Hook&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string single-quoted-string&quot;&gt;&#39;views_data&#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token delimiter punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

      &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token string single-quoted-string&quot;&gt;&#39;argument&#39;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token string single-quoted-string&quot;&gt;&#39;id&#39;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string single-quoted-string&quot;&gt;&#39;standard&#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token string single-quoted-string&quot;&gt;&#39;sort&#39;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token string single-quoted-string&quot;&gt;&#39;id&#39;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string single-quoted-string&quot;&gt;&#39;standard&#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token variable&quot;&gt;$data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This tells Drupal when it is looking for possible data to include in views that the H5P library type should be one of the pieces of data available, including first establishing the relationship between the table of H5P content with the table of H5P libraries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of that is straightforward if you&#39;ve exposed data to views before, but the one unique line is the filter ID being set to h5p_library_title. That is referencing a custom filter that is going to be defined next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-h5p-titles-filter&quot;&gt;The H5P Titles Filter&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The filter plugin is defined in src/Plugin/views/filter/H5pLibraryTitleFilter.php:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-php&quot; tabindex=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-php&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token php language-php&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token delimiter important&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;?php&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword static-context&quot;&gt;parent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;init&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token variable&quot;&gt;$view&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token variable&quot;&gt;$display&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token variable&quot;&gt;$options&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This accomplishes two things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The big one is the getValueOptions function. This function determines which options are available in the dropdown. It will query content from the database, get associated H5P library types, then join that to the table with all the details about the libraries so that we can get to the friendly display name. It will treat multiple libraries as the same if they have the same title, which we want because with H5P libraries you can keep older versions when the new ones are installed and there might even be content still using the old library version. For the purposes of a filter we want those to be treated as if they are the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second is much simpler: the InOperator class that this is extending from will default to showing those options as checkboxes. I want it to default to a dropdown (&amp;quot;select&amp;quot;) instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With those two core pieces, plus a schema file and the obligatory info.yml file, are all that you need in terms of code. Now when editing a view of H5P content, you can show the library type, including with a friendly dropdown of the types in an exposed filter.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>PHP Lint and CS Testing</title>
    <link href="https://tech.ryanrobinson.ca/2025/devenv-phplint/" />
    <updated>2025-12-23T16:05:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://tech.ryanrobinson.ca/2025/devenv-phplint/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This post is one of several in a series detailing my development environment and CI/CD deployment pipeline. &lt;a href=&quot;https://gitlab.com/ryan-l-robinson/drupal-dev-environment&quot;&gt;The code for the developer environment can be seen on my GitLab&lt;/a&gt;. Other posts in the series can be seen by checking the Drupal Docker series links in the sidebar. I provided &lt;a href=&quot;https://tech.ryanrobinson.ca/2025/drupal-docker-deploys-overview/&quot;&gt;an overview in the first post of the series&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This series has now covered all the core functionality of having a local development environment and deploying updates. The majority of what&#39;s left has to do with automated testing, including this one where I will start to look at PHP linting and PHP CodeSniffer, a couple of tools to help detect errors in PHP code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;php-lint&quot;&gt;PHP Lint&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PHP linting checks for any fatal errors. These kinds of errors are a lot harder to keep in the code long enough to commit it into GitLab if you were using a full dedicated developer environments with things like syntax and error highlighting, because you&#39;re probably going to notice it first. With that said, it is still a good failsafe to have, and it doesn&#39;t take that long to run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&#39;s a GitLab CI/CD approach to scan any PHP changes in case of any fatal error, starting with a general extendable job which will scan all files recursively in any specified directories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-yml&quot; tabindex=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-yml&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;.php_lint&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;stage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; test
  &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;image&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; drupal&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;php8.3&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;apache
  &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;variables&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;DIRECTORIES&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;./&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;EXTENSIONS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;php&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;script&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;# Recursively checks for files of specified extensions in specified directories and completes php lint on them. #&lt;/span&gt;

        do
          cd $DIRECTORY
          for EXT in $EXTENSIONS
            do
              files=&quot;$(find -name *.${EXT} -type f)&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

              for file in $&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;files&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
                do php &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;l $&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;file&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;;
              done;
            done;
          cd $cwd;
        done;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each project can then set up up a CI/CD job to implement it, like this one that runs on any custom code change as well as on dev and staging, checking each of those custom code directories:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-yml&quot; tabindex=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-yml&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;include&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;project&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;ryan-l-robinson/gitlab-ci&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;ref&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; main
    &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;file&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; test.yml

&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;## Stages ##&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;stages&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; test

&lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;php_lint&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;extends&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; .php_lint
  &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;variables&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;DIRECTORIES&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; ./web/themes/custom ./web/modules/custom
    &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;EXTENSIONS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; php module theme inc
  &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;rules&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&#39;$CI_PIPELINE_SOURCE == &quot;merge_request_event&quot;&#39;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;when&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; never
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&#39;$CI_COMMIT_BRANCH == &quot;dev&quot; || $CI_COMMIT_BRANCH == &quot;staging&quot;&#39;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;changes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; web/modules/custom/&lt;span class=&quot;token important&quot;&gt;**/*&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; web/themes/custom/&lt;span class=&quot;token important&quot;&gt;**/*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;php-codesniffer&quot;&gt;PHP CodeSniffer&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CodeSniffer helps enforce more strict coding standards. There are standards defined for both Drupal and DrupalPractice. Drupal covers a lot of the basic bare minimum compliance with Drupal standards: indentation, style, and file structure. DrupalPractice goes further to offer deeper best practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one is a one-line script, so I haven&#39;t bothered to split it into a dedicated separate template. This is just one job, in the project&#39;s .gitlab-ci.yml:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-yml&quot; tabindex=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-yml&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;### CodeSniffer for coding style ###&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;php_cs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;stage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; php_built_test
  &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;image&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; $CI_REGISTRY_IMAGE/web&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;$CI_COMMIT_REF_SLUG
  &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;script&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; /opt/drupal/vendor/bin/phpcs &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;standard=&quot;Drupal&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;DrupalPractice&quot; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;n &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;extensions=&quot;php&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;module&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;inc&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;install&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;test&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;theme&quot; web/themes/custom web/modules/custom &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;ignore=&lt;span class=&quot;token important&quot;&gt;*/vendor/*&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;rules&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&#39;$CI_PIPELINE_SOURCE == &quot;merge_request_event&quot;&#39;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;when&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; never
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&#39;$CI_COMMIT_BRANCH == &quot;dev&quot;&#39;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&#39;$CI_COMMIT_BRANCH == &quot;staging&quot; || $CI_COMMIT_BRANCH == &quot;main&quot;&#39;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;when&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; never
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;changes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; web/modules/custom/&lt;span class=&quot;token important&quot;&gt;**/*&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; web/themes/custom/&lt;span class=&quot;token important&quot;&gt;**/*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key thing to note here, unlike with PHP linting, is that this needs to run after an updated web image is built. PHP linting is looking for the kind of errors that are visible simply by reading the code, so it can run before the build and if something fails, you don&#39;t even need to waste the time on the build. PHP CodeSniffer, though, needs some vendor files which only happen when the composer packages are installed, which is normally part of the build process.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Deploying Containers</title>
    <link href="https://tech.ryanrobinson.ca/2025/devenv-deploy-update-jobs/" />
    <updated>2025-12-23T15:27:16Z</updated>
    <id>https://tech.ryanrobinson.ca/2025/devenv-deploy-update-jobs/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This post is one of several in a series detailing my development environment and CI/CD deployment pipeline. &lt;a href=&quot;https://gitlab.com/ryan-l-robinson/drupal-dev-environment&quot;&gt;The code for the developer environment can be seen on my GitLab&lt;/a&gt;. Other posts in the series can be seen by checking the Drupal Docker series links in the sidebar. I provided &lt;a href=&quot;https://tech.ryanrobinson.ca/2025/drupal-docker-deploys-overview/&quot;&gt;an overview in the first post of the series&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this post, I will look at the core of the process for deploying updates to a Docker swarm server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&#39;re starting to reach some of the parts of this series that I cannot give full code that I know works in other environments, because I do not have personally have my own Docker swarm servers to test things with. This component is based on what works with some of my work infrastructure. On a related note, I have structured the demo project so that jobs I don&#39;t actually have the environment to run are in the swarm.gitlab-ci.yml, as opposed to the main .gitlab-ci.yml which will actually run when I make new changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;deploy-job&quot;&gt;Deploy Job&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First up, we need to deploy the updated service to the swarm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;general-deployment-template&quot;&gt;General Deployment Template&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The core function to be able to deploy a stack to a Drupal swarm is &lt;code&gt;docker stack deploy&lt;/code&gt; but this gets more complicated because of another requirement: sometimes there is another docker-compose required to define differences for the other environments. I don&#39;t have those in my example, but they might be things like designating where to find the volumes, since the file structure on all environments is not always going to be the same. Because of that, it needs to first merge together more than one docker-compose file, before it deploys the stack of that combined file. It also will provide that combined file as an artifact, in case it&#39;s helpful for debugging issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-yml&quot; tabindex=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-yml&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;.deploy_template_swarm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;stage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; deploy
  &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;retry&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;max&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;when&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; script_failure
  &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;variables&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;STACK_NAME&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;COMPOSE_FILES&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; docker&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;compose.yml
  &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;script&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; echo &quot;$CI_REGISTRY_PASSWORD&quot; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; docker login $CI_REGISTRY &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;u $CI_REGISTRY_USER &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;password&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;stdin
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; if &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;z $COMPOSE_FILES &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;; then export COMPOSE_FILES=docker&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;compose.yml; fi
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;
      docker &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;log&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;level fatal
      compose
      $(printf &#39; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;f %s &#39; $(echo $COMPOSE_FILES &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; sed &#39;s/&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;/ /g&#39;))
      &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;p $STACK_NAME
      config
      &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;o docker&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;compose.rendered.yml
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; sed &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;i &#39;/^name&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class=&quot;token important&quot;&gt;*$/d&#39;&lt;/span&gt; docker&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;compose.rendered.yml
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; docker stack deploy
      &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;c docker&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;compose.rendered.yml
      &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;with&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;registry&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;auth
      &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;detach=false $STACK_NAME
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; docker logout
  &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;artifacts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;when&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; always
    &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;paths&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; docker&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;compose.rendered.yml&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;project-implementation-for-deployment&quot;&gt;Project Implementation for Deployment&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To implement that in a particular project, it would look something like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-yml&quot; tabindex=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-yml&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;prod_deploy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;stage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; deploy
  &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;extends&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; .deploy_template_swarm
  &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;allow_failure&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token boolean important&quot;&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;environment&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; Production
  &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;variables&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;STACK_NAME&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; library
    &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;COMPOSE_FILES&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; docker&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;compose.yml&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;docker&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;compose.local.storage.yml
    &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;WEB_REPLICA_COUNT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;DB_REPLICA_COUNT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;tags&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; prod
  &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;only&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;refs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; main&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This extends the template job. It requires combining two docker-compose files. It also passes through a couple of variables that we saw back in &lt;a href=&quot;https://tech.ryanrobinson.ca/2025/devenv-docker-compose/&quot;&gt;the docker-compose file&lt;/a&gt; to declare how many of each service we want to deploy to the swarm. This one runs on the prod server&#39;s tag, and only when merges are made into the main branch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;database-update-job&quot;&gt;Database Update Job&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, with Drupal specifically, we need to update the database to be in line with the new code. Clearing caches is also an essential step in Drupal deployments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;general-single-use-template&quot;&gt;General Single-Use Template&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To do this, I have a general &amp;quot;single use&amp;quot; job. At its simplest, it runs a script. Like the deployment, though, it gets more complicated, in this case because I wanted to be able to see the logs of that script running so that we know if there are any problems. That is what makes this a much longer script.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-yml&quot; tabindex=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-yml&quot;&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;## This is for single-use services, to run a specific script one time, before or after deployment. ##&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;.docker_single_use&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;variables&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;STACK_NAME&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;SERVICE_NAME&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;SERVICE_UP_WAIT_REPEAT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;12&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;SERVICE_UP_WAIT_TIME&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;SERVICE_CREATE_WAIT_REPEAT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;60&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To run this now on a specific project, you need a few things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First is the script that it is going to run, in a separate file under the scripts folder. As with &lt;a href=&quot;https://tech.ryanrobinson.ca/2025/devenv-start-script/&quot;&gt;the start script&lt;/a&gt;, it will first wait to confirm that it is able to connect to the database, returning an error if it didn&#39;t work after enough tries. Then it will use drush commands to import the latest configuration - twice, because if config_split is involved it might only apply the split in the first run and then change the split configurations on the second - then run any updates needed to the database and clear the caches.&lt;/p&gt;
