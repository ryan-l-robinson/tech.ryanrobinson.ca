    <title>Ecosia Browser and Search</title>
    <link href="https://tech.ryanrobinson.ca/posts/2025/ecosia/" />
    <updated>2025-03-12T17:54:16Z</updated>
    <id>https://tech.ryanrobinson.ca/posts/2025/ecosia/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I recently stumbled my way into hearing about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ecosia.org/&quot;&gt;Ecosia&lt;/a&gt;. They&#39;re a search engine and browser backed by a non-profit where they turn any excess revenue into planting trees. That sounds much nicer than the usual, excess revenue turning into the constantly-ballooning demand for more shareholder value. I decided to do some rough tests of each.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;browser&quot;&gt;Browser&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The browser is about as close to a barebones Chromium as you can get.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mobile app doesn&#39;t allow you to change your search engine from their ecosia, as far as I can find, so if you don&#39;t want to use that for search, that will quickly wipe out any value for that browser. The desktop app does allow that change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The desktop app doesn&#39;t come with the ad blocker enabled by default, but it is there in the settings. The mobile app includes it by default.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Otherwise, there&#39;s not a lot to talk about here that I can see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&#39;s not necessarily a bad thing. It might be pretty good for you, because it is as lightweight and efficient as possible without all the extra layers that Google adds to Chrome or Microsoft adds to Edge or even some of the other smaller Chromium variants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Professionally, I use enough of the extra crap that Microsoft adds to Edge, including but not limited to vertical tabs and a lot of little ways that Microsoft 365 is built in, that I think it still makes sense to keep Edge my primary work browser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My personal mobile browser I&#39;ll stick with Firefox if only because I can change my search engine and I&#39;m not sold on ecosia for that (see below).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&#39;s maybe a bit more room for me to consider it instead of Firefox as my primary desktop personal browser. They&#39;re probably pretty close on privacy protection, maybe a little better extension support, ad blocker built in, and it also being Chromium does make it a little more natural for me to use it personally as I do Edge professionally. I&#39;ll still call that aspect a maybe, but there isn&#39;t much of a selling point and if I&#39;m sticking with Firefox on mobile, there are some benefits in synchronization that I take advantage of often.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;search-engine&quot;&gt;Search Engine&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The search engine is largely a skin of either Google or Bing. You can select which set of results you prefer, if you allow some more cookies - it is nice that they give that choice and actually explain it, rather than throwing up a prompt and hoping you click yes. There are also some other providers that add instant answers and other features, with a lot of the more interesting ones being those that are more about social and environmental responsibility. Most of the categories of results show up within their interface, but then Maps just redirects you entirely to Google Maps. &lt;a href=&quot;https://ecosia.helpscoutdocs.com/article/579-search-results-providers&quot;&gt;See their documentation for more&lt;/a&gt;. If you&#39;re not regularly doing the kind of environmental research those extra features help with, I don&#39;t know if there&#39;s much of an advantage here but it may not be a meaningful step backwards either, while knowing you&#39;re helping plant trees instead of line investor accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It does also have an option for whether to have personalized search results, instead of assuming that obviously you want those to get slightly better results. I do think there are some cases where personalized results do help me. I do a lot of searches for Drupal things, and I might not always attach &amp;quot;Drupal&amp;quot; to the search terms, but my search engine with personalized results sometimes seems to skew the results toward it anyway. But it is still the right thing to allow people to decide whether that is worth more tracking. Also, as far as I can see, they don&#39;t try to do any tracking you anywhere else - just the searches that you make on their search engine if you enable it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, I&#39;m unlikely to change. I use Bing for a couple of reasons, one that is entirely selfish and one that is a bit more practical:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Microsoft Rewards funds my Xbox habit. I haven&#39;t paid for a game in years. I just build up points and then buy old games on a $15 sale that I can play for 200 hours and by the end of that I&#39;ve got lots of points for more.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Integrated SharePoint search. This is really useful if your organization does hold a lot of important information in SharePoint, as you can search it as fast as you could search the web.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ecosia isn&#39;t doing enough to make me want to replace those, as much as in principle I would love to support their cause. Maybe I could do like the browser: keep Bing for my work searches and switch to ecosia for personal searches. On personal searches the SharePoint aspect is a moot point, and I could probably still pick up enough reward points from professional searches that I could still keep my gaming backlog longer than I ever have much hope of catching up to. I&#39;ll keep considering that, maybe come back to see if it has evolved at all every few months.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Opening Links in New Tabs</title>
    <link href="https://tech.ryanrobinson.ca/posts/2025/link-new-window/" />
    <updated>2025-02-23T17:50:16Z</updated>
    <id>https://tech.ryanrobinson.ca/posts/2025/link-new-window/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Links can be set to open in new windows/tabs or (by default) not. You mostly shouldn&#39;t do that, but there are a few exceptions and a few ways to carry out those exceptions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;accessibility-when-to-do-it&quot;&gt;Accessibility: When to Do It&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decision for whether to open links in a new tab is not a simple matter of personal preference. You need to think about the experience for all users, including those relying on assistive technology such as screen readers. Most of the time, don&#39;t open in a new tab. This is because it can be confusing in a screen reader to be directed into a new tab without noticing, then being unable to use features they&#39;re used to like a back button. That&#39;s bad, so mostly don&#39;t do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is one exception category, however: if the user needs to reference the new tab while still doing something in the original tab. The most common scenario is a form that has a link to more information about something that might change you fill out the form. If you go to the extra information in the same tab, you lose all the work filling out the form so far, and there&#39;s no potential to go back and forth. In that case, a new tab is worthwhile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;accessibility-how-to-do-it&quot;&gt;Accessibility: How to Do It&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that said, if you do need to do it, it needs to be as clear as possible (without being unnecessarily annoying) to all of the users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;verbal-indicator&quot;&gt;Verbal Indicator&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It needs to be especially clear to those who cannot see that the new tab has been opened. To do this, make sure one way or another that it will be announced to the screen reader before they click. The easiest way to do that is to set the aria-label. For example, if the link&#39;s visible text said &amp;quot;privacy policy&amp;quot; then the aria-label would be &amp;quot;privacy policy, opens in new window.&amp;quot; That might not be the most obvious to do within a content management system context, but often there is a way; if you&#39;re a developer and not just a content creator, it&#39;s your job to figure out how to offer that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;visual-indicator&quot;&gt;Visual Indicator&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While maybe not quite as urgent, similar to the point above, you do also want to notify sighted users that a new window is about to open. Sure, they can tell afterward because they can see the extra tab open, but it can still be an extra nuisance if it catches them off guard. So for that, I decided on a fairly common approach of adding an icon after any link that opens in new tabs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&#39;s a quick bit of CSS to help show an icon for any link set to open in a new tab/window. I grabbed an icon from Font Awesome that is a pretty standard one for this purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, if you don&#39;t use it already, make sure the source of the icon is loaded in your site. In my case, I used &lt;a href=&quot;https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/6.7.2/css/all.min.css&quot;&gt;the all CSS path&lt;/a&gt;. This link is for the current version 6.7.2. You may need to look up the latest version. You also might be happy with a smaller version for a subset of the icons; in my case I was using enough other ones in other contexts that it made sense to take it all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now you can add a style like this to the appropriate place in your stylesheet:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-css&quot; tabindex=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-css&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token selector&quot;&gt;a[target=&quot;_blank&quot;]::after&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;display&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; inline-flex&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;margin-left&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; 5px&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;content&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;&#92;f08e&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;font-family&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;FontAwesome&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The display value of inline-flex has a minor advantage in my case compared to the default. My links are normally underlined. Without that inline-flex distinction, the icon would also be underlined, but that margin in between the text and icon would not be, which looks awkward. By switching the display value, it removed the underline from the icon, looking cleaner.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The State of Podcasts 2025</title>
    <link href="https://tech.ryanrobinson.ca/posts/2025/podcasts/" />
    <updated>2025-01-08T18:32:16Z</updated>
    <id>https://tech.ryanrobinson.ca/posts/2025/podcasts/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s a new year (happy 2025) and a good chance to review the state of my podcast feeds. I&#39;m a major podcast listener, with something running in the background a lot of the time that I&#39;m working or playing Xbox or cleaning or on a bus or a lot of other times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here are a few scattered thoughts about podcasts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;is-this-healthy&quot;&gt;Is This Healthy?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First it is fair to ask whether it is good for me that I listen to podcasts for large portions of the day. We also have a YouTube Music subscription. I could be listening to ad-free music instead, and I often think I should be doing that more, or even &lt;em&gt;gasp&lt;/em&gt; allow myself some occasional silence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a subset of the general problem of &amp;quot;there&#39;s too much content&amp;quot; which also applies to other types of media. There just isn&#39;t nearly enough time in a day to listen to all the good podcasts and watch all the good shows and read the good books and listen to all the good audiobooks and play the good games. And I think I&#39;m starting to lean toward wanting to have less podcast content (and maybe less TV) but be more picky about it being the best, freeing up the other time for books or music or silence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;pricing-models&quot;&gt;Pricing Models&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That leads into revenue models, because I don&#39;t really want to be paying for a lot of stuff that I can&#39;t even keep up with anyway. So with that in mind, it got me thinking about the state of podcast pricing models, because there is some wild variety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are three general ways to make money off podcasts that I have encountered, and they may be combined in various ways:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ads, in a couple of varieties: in the more user-friendly case, these are host-read ads. Those are context sensitive (e.g. if it&#39;s a tech podcast, it has ads that are relevant to tech professionals, in the same way that it is impossible to watch sports without getting sports gambling ads). I don&#39;t mind those most of the time, but they are getting less and less common. In the worse case, they are targeted surveillance ads, based on tracking you all over the Internet and inserted as you download/listen. They also tend to be precorded and inserted, which is more jarring than hearing the hosts read it. I really have a limit on how many surveillance ads I&#39;ll put up with.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Paid subscription tiers: it&#39;s pretty common to have some content be free and then more bonus content be behind a subscription paywall. There&#39;s a spectrum here between how much they try to sell you on additional content vs how much it is treated more like a donation appeal. This is where some of the comparisons I&#39;ll make below get really interesting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Loss leader for something else: the podcast itself could essentially be an ad for a larger product that the podcast is associated with, like a newspaper&#39;s podcasts that are consistently if subtly pushing toward getting a newspaper subscription, or a university&#39;s podcasts that might subtly convince you to take classes there or donate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course there are also a handful of podcasts that are purely a labour of love and don&#39;t make any money, but that&#39;s tough to maintain because they can&#39;t even buy things like quality equipment. I don&#39;t think I have any of those anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here&#39;s the breakdown of the pricing models of the podcasts I currently have in my queue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;this-week-in-tech&quot;&gt;This Week in Tech&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ll start with my tech podcasts since this a tech blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The TWiT (This Week in Tech) network is a great bargain compared to anything else in my feeds, with their &lt;a href=&quot;https://twit.tv/clubtwit&quot;&gt;Club TWiT&lt;/a&gt; offering. It&#39;s only $7 (all prices USD) a month for a lot of good shows. Even before I joined the paid level, a couple of their shows - Windows Weekly and the flagship This Week in Tech - were the only tech shows I was still listening to. Everything else died for some reason or another; at least some were because they did not have sustainable revenue models. Before subscribing I only listened to those two. Now subscribed I&#39;m trying out at least a few more: This Week in Google (great host chemistry and not really that focused on Google), Tech News Weekly (very interesting so far), Security Now (great topics but a bit harder to listen to with only one speaker for the most part), Home Theatre Geeks (some episodes are really interesting to me, but not others). The subscription unlocks a few things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ad-free episodes. That opts out of both host read ads and surveillance ads, although they do interestingly provide an extra feed for the host read ads for those who do still want them, since they are actually relevant and screened by their experts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A Discord community with a channel for each show that allows things like submitting questions, as well as live chats while the shows are airing live. I usually listen after the fact via podcast, not live, so that isn&#39;t a huge selling point for me, but I did sign up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some odds and ends of bonus content, like a book club and Ask Me Anything interviews. Some of these are interesting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, that&#39;s a pretty good balance of carrot (some bonus content and community) and stick (ads you have to listen to if not).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;nebula&quot;&gt;Nebula&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ll reference Nebula in its own category. I follow three of their podcasts, using the Nebula exclusive feed. This means no ads. Nebula is an excellent deal at $30/year. For that, you get:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ad-free videos from some of the best educational content creators out there.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Extended versions of those videos.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exclusive content from those creators, including some short movies they have produced.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ad-free on any of the podcasts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&#39;s a pretty great deal, compared to YouTube Premium to avoid ads there, which is $14/month for an individual or $23/month for a family. Nebula is barely more for a year than YouTube Premium Family is for a month, and they have almost all of my favourite YouTube creators (we still have YouTube Premium as well, primarily for music).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;movies-and-comedy&quot;&gt;Movies and Comedy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I listen to all five shows from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fromsuperheroes.com/&quot;&gt;the From Superheroes network&lt;/a&gt;. There is no network bundle price. Each show has their own Patreon, with different tiers. The tier to avoid ads and get bonus content, on the ones that offer that, are up around $10/month. Per show. They do have some other small perks as well, like being able to vote on audience choice episodes. I really like their shows, but they are the worst value for the money from my feed, and it feels even more ridiculous if you start comparing it to things like video streaming platforms. That&#39;s a high barrier of entry, so they have a lot less paid subscribers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-you-re-wrong-about-family&quot;&gt;The &amp;quot;You&#39;re Wrong About&amp;quot; Family&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&#39;re Wrong About was the first podcast with Sarah Marshall and Michael Hobbes. Michael is no longer on that one, but hosts If Books Could Kill that I also listen to. Sarah also hosts You Are Good. All three of these follow the same model. They&#39;re ad-free for anybody. Then they have a Patreon that is mostly pitched as a way to support them, only $2-4 a month (depending on the podcast) to get bonus episodes. If Books Could Kill also has a couple higher tiers to join a Discord and vote on books. So they&#39;re leaning heavily toward the carrot, with no real penalty to listening for free, but a low cost to get bonus episodes, meaning they probably get by mostly on a massive number of subscribers at a small price per person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;christian&quot;&gt;Christian&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.homebrewedchristianty.com/podcasts/&quot;&gt;Homebrewed Christianity&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://thebiblefornormalpeople.com/&quot;&gt;The Bible for Normal People&lt;/a&gt; have a similar model: the main podcast feed has ads - both host-read and surveillance - and there is also a paid subscription option. In both cases, you get a lot for the paid subscription:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ad-free podcasts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;extensive classes taught by experts in theology/biblical studies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;online community&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;extra written content (Homebrewed Christianity)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TB4P is cheaper, at $12 USD per month, or $11 if you commit to a year up front, while Homebrewed is $25/month if you commit to a year. Homebrewed does also have a cheaper tier for just ad-free podcasts but not the classes. It&#39;s a little pricey but not so much when you compare to auditing a seminary course, which is basically what the classes are offering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reclaimingmytheology.org/&quot;&gt;Reclaiming My Theology&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://jarrodmckenna.com/inverse-podcast/&quot;&gt;Inverse&lt;/a&gt; have a model similar to the &amp;quot;You&#39;re Wrong About&amp;quot; group, or somewhere between those and the two above. There are no ads for the general public feed, then they have Patreon options that include things like extra content and more direct connection to community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then there are a few I listen to in the third category I mentioned above:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://whchurch.org/&quot;&gt;Woodland Hills Church&lt;/a&gt; is a podcast sermon feed, so no ads there but they would take donations to the church from the virtual congregation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://reknew.org/&quot;&gt;ReKnew&lt;/a&gt;&#39;s Apologies and Explanations come from roughly the same group of people, also ad-free but does accept donations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://divinity.yale.edu/news/yds-podcasts&quot;&gt;Yale Divinity School&lt;/a&gt; has an occasional podcast that is ad-free but definitely helps build good will to their seminary.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;sports&quot;&gt;Sports&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sports skews the most heavily towards ads, mostly surveillance, being the only option. That is a big part of why I&#39;ve cut down my sports podcasts, along with there simply being so many, even though other than the ads they do tend to make great white noise while working.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have two from The Athletic: No Dunks primarily focused on men&#39;s basketball and The Athletic Women&#39;s Basketball Show as the name suggests primarily focused on women. They both have ads, both surveillance and host-read. When The Athletic was independent, you could subscribe and get the writing and the podcasts ad-free, but you had to use their app - there was no way to put the podcast into your regular feed - which meant other limitations like not being able to cast to a speaker or put in a queue with other episodes. I haven&#39;t tried subscribing again, but from what I have been able to read online, a subscription is now twice as expensive and doesn&#39;t avoid ads and I don&#39;t know if they solved the feed problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://thesonarnetwork.com/the-pick-up/&quot;&gt;The Pickup&lt;/a&gt; is a WNBA comedy podcast. That&#39;s all surveillance ads. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sportsnet.ca/590/raptors-show/&quot;&gt;The Raptors Show&lt;/a&gt; is some surveillance and some host ads. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.raptorsrepublic.com/&quot;&gt;Raptors Republic&lt;/a&gt; was all surveillance ads. I might drop all of those from my rotation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Newly added to check out: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.siriusxm.com/blog/katie-nolan-casuals-podcast&quot;&gt;Katie Nolan has a new podcast&lt;/a&gt;. I loved her old podcast with ESPN. I can guarantee that will be ad-based, some combination of host-read (she&#39;s a great comedic ad reader) and surveillance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bringing Home the W is a very specific show about the start of the Toronto Tempo WNBA team, giving a look behind the scenes. This has no ads, because the entire thing is essentially an ad to be excited for the upcoming team (and I am).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we&#39;ve got a wide range of pricing models. Some only give you options for ads, especially the sports ones, maybe because they know that they&#39;re more often white noise, unlike some of these other categories where you&#39;re more likely to be listening and taking notes. When you are listening and taking notes, the ads are more jarring and you&#39;re more invested so more willing to pay to get rid of them and/or to get bonus content. Some other are all-in with the bonus content paid model and no ads, which I love to see. Some combine the two, with a large difference in price between the two networks I have doing that, TWiT and From Superheroes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-now&quot;&gt;What Now&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I already added Club TWiT recently. That&#39;s a good deal for a lot of good podcasts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m tempted by the &amp;quot;You&#39;re Wrong About&amp;quot; family, because they are so cheap to get the bonuses, and I do kind of want to encourage that model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m likely going to subscribe for the extra classes from either Homebrewed Christianity or Bible for Normal People. But it&#39;s probably a bit too much (both in money and in time to keep up) to do both of them at the same time, so maybe I go for a year of B4NP and then a year of Homebrewed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m likely going the other way on sports, cutting back significantly because there are just too many of them with too many surveillance ads, and if I have to cut something to make some time, those are the most obvious to go.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A Brief Experiment in a Mastodon Self-Managed Instance</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I took advantage of a Black Friday deal from &lt;a href=&quot;https://fedihost.co/&quot;&gt;fedihost.co&lt;/a&gt; to try out using a managed host for a Mastodon account, as compared to the large Canadian instance &lt;a href=&quot;https://mstdn.ca&quot;&gt;mstdn.ca&lt;/a&gt; that I have been using since my early days of joining Mastodon. It was $1/month for the lowest plan for a year, which is pretty solidly in impulse purchase territory, so it was a worthwhile idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To clarify, this is not an experiment in self-hosting in the strictest sense. I&#39;m not doing any of the server or software maintenance myself. It&#39;s more like self-administering. Some professionals I&#39;m paying did all the server and software work. I just administered users, which in this case was just me, and general settings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, here&#39;s how that experiment went. You might already have some ideas from words I&#39;ve used like &amp;quot;brief&amp;quot; and how a Black Friday deal experiment is now all past tense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;signup&quot;&gt;Signup&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The process with fedihost was easy. It gave me the DNS record to create first, then I came back the next day to confirm it propagated, and signed up including a payment method. Soon after, I got an email that everything was ready, with a link to the dashboard. That dashboard is minimal but had a few options for managing services like how many days of cache to keep, which would quickly become an essential option (see under Storage below). It also showed me a randomly generated admin password I could use to sign in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;domain&quot;&gt;Domain&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest benefit of this option may be that I could use a subdomain of my main domain, creating mstdn.ryanrobinson.ca. If you really care about your branding, that&#39;s a big selling point, plus as Bluesky has demonstrated, it&#39;s a form of verification that you are the same person who owns that website. Mastodon does have a more subtle version already, where you can put a link on your site coded in the correct way, then put that website URL in your profile and it will show with a check mark. But that&#39;s fairly hidden on a user profile, not directly in a handle or anywhere close to the now-infamous blue check on Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The downside of this, at least in my case, was that now my handle became much more unwieldy. I have a pretty great handle at mstdn.ca, simply @Ryan@mstdn.ca. That&#39;s rare with my very common name to get that good of a handle. It&#39;s clean, easy, not taking up much space. With the managed hosting, I got @Ryan@mstdn.ryanrobinson.ca, which gets to use my domain but looks much clunkier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;trending&quot;&gt;Trending&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I had thought it through, I would have predicted that trending would be less useful. With less wide range of federation, less tags and links will come in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I never would have thought of was that I would need to approve each tag and each link before it can even show up within the typical user app. I get why that&#39;s an admin moderation function, to not let hate speech or whatever else you don&#39;t want to be visible for other users. But when you&#39;re the only user, it means you can&#39;t see anything trending in the app until you&#39;ve first already seen it in the admin panel, for which I get a few emails a day to review. Those emails will decrease quickly because once I&#39;ve approved it once, I don&#39;t need to again, but that is an annoying extra step with zero benefit when it&#39;s a single-user instance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;search&quot;&gt;Search&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Search is also less powerful with less federation, although that was less of a problem in my few days of testing. It&#39;s not that often that I really want to search for a topic. At this point I mostly follow who I follow, not going looking for what strangers are saying about something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;moderation&quot;&gt;Moderation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moderation is the area I can probably say with least confidence because I was doing it for such a short period of time. I didn&#39;t have a lot of connections, and I did not end up doing any of my own moderation. That&#39;s the upside of the limited federation. This was the thing that I was worried would be the biggest extra piece of work, because I really have no desire to squash a bunch of crypto scammers or hate speech on my own. Maybe it would have become more of a problem on a longer scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;markdown&quot;&gt;Markdown&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This managed hosting instance did not support markdown as mstdn.ca does. This isn&#39;t a huge deal, but I do appreciate having it, especially for links since there isn&#39;t a guarantee that every app has link previews so I want to at least give it readable link text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;local-feed&quot;&gt;Local Feed&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I rarely use the one on mstdn.ca, but the entire concept of a local feed is meaningless on a single-user instance. It&#39;s just me. I may as well look at my profile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;storage&quot;&gt;Storage&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cheap plan, the one that was so cheap on Black Friday as to spark an impulse purchase, comes with 10GB. That feels like it should be a lot for one social media account with auto-deleting posts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After initial install I was using about 2.5GB.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the second day, I had a warning email letting me know that I was over 80% and if I fill it up, I will be automatically upgraded to the next plan which does not have the Black Friday bargain prices. So I went in to the dashboard and cut the caching option from keeping 10 days down to only 1. The next morning I saw I was back down to about 65% used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still got another warning email the next day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I decided that there was nothing left to learn in this experiment and decided to delete. I was at 97% of my storage even though I had barely logged in today and had the 1 day cache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was inevitable I would have been paying more for it soon, which takes it not only past the $1/month bargain but also past the $6/month regular price for that plan that is roughly equivalent to what I am donating to mstdn.ca.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, it&#39;s a fine option. It&#39;s reliable, affordable, not a lot of extra work, and has some benefits if you really want to be able to shape it to be exactly what you want from moderation decisions to the domain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I think it&#39;s a step backward in my case. It&#39;s still some more time required, a clunky handle, and almost certainly would have ended up paying a fair bit more to support more storage than I am donating to mstdn.ca. The storage challenge helped rush the decision, but really, it was already becoming clear that there was nothing else left I might learn to convince me it would be better off than what I&#39;m using now. I&#39;m going back to mstdn.ca full time.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Accessible Fonts</title>
    <link href="https://tech.ryanrobinson.ca/posts/2024/accessible-fonts/" />
    <updated>2024-12-04T17:50:37Z</updated>
    <id>https://tech.ryanrobinson.ca/posts/2024/accessible-fonts/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I recently did some research on the accessibility of a variety of fonts. It&#39;s an interesting area, and it is one of those areas of accessibility where there is no one solution that is absolutely perfect for everybody. A font that is great for one particular reading disability may be a big problem for others. In other words, there are two big things to keep in mind, as always in accessibility:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Know your audience. If you&#39;re specifically targeting people with dyslexia, your decision will be different than for the general public.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pursue an additive approach where possible. If one font can&#39;t help everyone, set a default to be something that is best for as many as possible, then have something like the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.drupal.org/project/fluidui&quot;&gt;Fluid UI framework for Drupal&lt;/a&gt; which can allow users to select something else that might be better for them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that said, here are some of the things I learned to consider when looking at fonts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;testing&quot;&gt;Testing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How did I test these? With most fonts, I could generate samples using &lt;a href=&quot;https://fonts.google.com/&quot;&gt;Google Fonts&lt;/a&gt; and/or &lt;a href=&quot;https://fonts.adobe.com/&quot;&gt;Adobe Fonts&lt;/a&gt;. I typed in the scenario I was trying to test and took notes on how well they do in each of the categories below, slowly cutting down which fonts were serious contenders. As I got down to only a few options, I also tried putting them into the site I was considering fonts for so I could see it within our specific context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;doubles&quot;&gt;Doubles&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doubles are pairs of characters that look too similar to be able to tell about, at least without other context. In some fonts with really bad doubles, this doesn&#39;t even require any extra reading disability - it applies to all of us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One cluster of these are the characters that are mostly straight lines in some fonts. This site won&#39;t demonstrate the problem, but in a lot of fonts, try l (lowercase letter L), the number 1, uppercase letter I, and the pipe |. There have been a handful of times in the past couple of years that I&#39;ve seen so many people talking about AI, then somebody mentions a guy named Al and I am very confused because in the font of wherever I saw it, I could not tell them apart. When I did the testing, I often found that most fonts were good at distinguishing two or three of those four from each other, but not that many of them were obvious enough for all four characters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another very common double is the uppercase O with the number 0. In a lot of fonts, the letter is wider, but otherwise they look very similar. If it&#39;s not in the middle of a different number, you can&#39;t tell it apart. How many times you have seen an alphanumeric code like a password printed on something and not been able to tell whether it was a 0 or an O? Other than being a little skinnier for the number, the most obvious way to differentiate is to put a line through the 0, as this site&#39;s font does. Depending on the context, that might be more annoying to read than it is helpful to differentiate, but it should be something you consider.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;mirrors&quot;&gt;Mirrors&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mirrors are a little different, the pairs of letters that are distinct from each other but very similar if you flip one of them, which can be a problem for dyslexia. The two common examples are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;pq&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;db&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look at them side-by-side. Can you see what&#39;s different, maybe an extra serif on one that&#39;s not on the other to tell them apart?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;spacing&quot;&gt;Spacing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one isn&#39;t quite as easy to say pass or fail, but I tried to judge how readable the spacing was between letters. I found when fonts were too skinny they became hard to read, with the letters blurring together. But too far apart might also be hard to read, and also increases the pages size which results in more scrolling and that&#39;s a cognitive load in a different way. There is some sweet spot, which might be different for all of us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;monospace&quot;&gt;Monospace&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most fonts allow different letters to have different widths, which is another way to help them stand out from each other. There&#39;s a reason why an &amp;quot;em&amp;quot; is a unit of measurement in HTML/CSS: because the letter m is the widest letter, so it is a way of saying &amp;quot;I want to fit at least this many letters here.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The exception where monospace fonts - those with the same width for all letters - are often preferred is for coding. Knowing that each letter is the same width is very helpful for keeping the code blocks lined and being able to judge how many characters are there. So if you&#39;re including code snippets on your site, you might want a monospace font for those, but otherwise you probably don&#39;t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusions&quot;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what did I land on?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.brailleinstitute.org/freefont/&quot;&gt;Braille Institute&#39;s Atkinson Hyperlegible&lt;/a&gt; was the best across all those tests, which makes sense given that it was very intentionally designed for accessibility. I&#39;m using it for this site for that reason. The 0 with the strike through is a bit jarring for some, as I mentioned above, but I am starting to really like it. I&#39;ve even started using it in other apps that offer it (e.g. &lt;a href=&quot;https://pachli.app/download/&quot;&gt;Pachli&lt;/a&gt;, the Mastodon app for Android).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tahoma scored well on most fronts, other than the 0 and O mirror. Of the major fonts by default available on most systems already, this came out as my winner. It is the most friendly to the most number of people, maybe scoring a little lowr than Atkinson Hyperlegible on some of the mirrors and doubles, but quite well on everything else, and without the line through the 0 that is a distraction to a fair number of people. In a professional context with a general audience, there&#39;s a good case to take this over Atkinson Hyperlegible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comic Sans, mocked by much of the Internet, is considered one of the best fonts for dyslexia, because it doesn&#39;t have mirrors. Every letter is easy to differentiate. But I think it is valid to point out that it can cause readability problems for most others, so if your site is general purpose rather than targeting the dyslexic community specifically, it might not be a great choice. There is also an Open Dyslexic that is similar, which is particularly targeted for dyslexic users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some others that scored generally ok: Aptos, the new Microsoft 365 default font; Arial; and Verdana (much like Tahoma but a bit wider).&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Site Rebuilt in Eleventy</title>
    <link href="https://tech.ryanrobinson.ca/posts/2024/switch-to-eleventy/" />
    <updated>2024-11-24T19:04:42Z</updated>
    <id>https://tech.ryanrobinson.ca/posts/2024/switch-to-eleventy/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I have rebuilt this site in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.11ty.dev/&quot;&gt;Eleventy&lt;/a&gt;, replacing the previous Jekyll version. Here are some of my thoughts on the experience:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;advantages&quot;&gt;Advantages&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s got a couple advantages over my Jekyll experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One that eleventy tends to brag about is that it builds very fast. This doesn&#39;t matter that much to me in the context of a simple site mostly hosting blogs on GitHub Pages, but it is nice to at least know when I commit something that it will be visible for testing quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bigger one for me has been that I understand it more. I got the hang of the templating system pretty quickly, as its nunjucks is not far off from the twig I use for Drupal. With the old Jekyll site, it mostly felt like a black box that I didn&#39;t have enough control over. There probably was a way, but it wasn&#39;t obvious. Here I know what files are contributing to the markup, what files are contributing to the styles, and what extra JavaScript is running.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;search&quot;&gt;Search&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Search is one of the more significant disadvantages. There is no default search module. I implemented &lt;a href=&quot;https://pagefind.app/&quot;&gt;PageFind&lt;/a&gt;. This mostly works well enough, and wasn&#39;t that hard to figure out, but unlike the big advantage noted above with eleventy templates, there isn&#39;t a huge amount of control over the UI of the end result. The largest problem I have with that is I am unsure it is the most accessible possible, e.g. it does not create &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Attributes/aria-live&quot;&gt;an aria-live region&lt;/a&gt; when the content visible on the page has been changed, so screen reader users may not even know the new content is being displayed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;taxonomy-pages&quot;&gt;Taxonomy Pages&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other big-ish technical piece that I have not solved yet is having pagination on the term pages like &lt;a href=&quot;https://tech.ryanrobinson.ca/tags/accessibility/&quot;&gt;the one for accessibility&lt;/a&gt;. This is because pagination is itself used to create those taxonomy pages programmatically, rather than needing to set up each tag&#39;s page manually, and there is no support for another level of pagination within those.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn&#39;t a huge problem for me at the moment, since my most-populated tag is at 49 posts and that isn&#39;t unreasonable to show on one page. But it could become a more serious problem eventually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;post-tl-dr&quot;&gt;Post tl;dr&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because there is relatively easy flexibility of what metadata you track for posts and how those appear in templates, I could do things like add a post tl;dr that shows as the summary on the posts lists, as well as the top of the individual post display. This is intended to be a quick summary when you visit a page, to understand if this is going to answer your question or whether you should look somewhere else. That came out of some consultation with a screen reader user, who expressed how it can be hard to get to a page and have to listen to the whole thing only to realize that she is on the wrong page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;series&quot;&gt;Series&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I created another taxonomy for the series of a post. Now, if a post is part of a series, that whole series will appear in the sidebar of that post, making it easier to jump to other posts that you might need to read first or want to read next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;post-changes&quot;&gt;Post Changes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of the metadata in my posts needed to change to support this new structure instead of Jekyll&#39;s, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add a description for each post to serve as the tldr.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remove the category field which is no longer relevant.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Change the filename to what I want the permalink to be, and remove the permalink from the front matter. It is possible to set the permalink through front matter to override the file name, but at least for now I&#39;ve gone with simplicity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Update any links and image references, since those are all in new locations now.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;domain&quot;&gt;Domain&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have also changed the domain. Instead of ryanrobinson.technology, I&#39;m using a subdomain, tech.ryanrobinson.ca. This is primarily an effort to simplify my web presence around the one main domain that hosts a broad landing page about me. Now that I have a better idea of how to build a site with eleventy, and have a theme I&#39;m mostly happy with (some improvements noted below notwithstanding), I will likely make more subdomains off of ryanrobinson.ca for other types of blog content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;still-to-do&quot;&gt;Still To Do&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I am declaring this good enough to phase out the old site and get back to some writing, there are a few things I hope to still do as of writing this post:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As mentioned above, I don&#39;t think the search functionality is as accessible as it can be. I may have to make a copy of the PageFind JavaScript UI in order to rework some of it, while keeping PageFind&#39;s handling of other aspects like building the index.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The styles are not all great. I think they&#39;re readable, but there are things like the black of the dark mode probably still being too black.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I have done some passes to review the posts, but it might not all be there yet. I need to review all the descriptions, tags, and series.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    <title>VS Code: University Colour Palettes</title>
    <link href="https://tech.ryanrobinson.ca/posts/2024/vs-code-university-colour-palettes/" />
    <updated>2024-04-08T17:10:28Z</updated>
    <id>https://tech.ryanrobinson.ca/posts/2024/vs-code-university-colour-palettes/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I like changing colour palettes on my various workspaces. It’s especially nice when in situations like jumping between personal and work spaces of the same app, or multiple clients, or dev vs staging vs production servers. It&#39;s a great way to quickly adjust what I&#39;m thinking about, e.g. if I&#39;m seeing yellow or purple or red, it immediately slows me down to be a lot more careful about what I&#39;m changing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, one of the things I’ve done is have different colour palettes in Visual Studio Code for different servers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One set of colours are for Wilfrid Laurier University, where I work. I personally use the green one for my primary development container, yellow for dev, purple for staging, and red for production (red because I shouldn’t ever actually be editing directly on production). I also use the pure black one with the brand colours as accents for when I am editing something local to my Windows host machine, not in any docker or remote SSH.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then, just for fun, I decided to do the same with my alma mater university, Queen’s. And then a couple of other nearby universities, Waterloo and Guelph. I haven&#39;t heavily tested those so maybe some of the fringe contrasts aren&#39;t quite right, and some of them (Waterloo) offers less range in colours than others. But they&#39;re at least a starting point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They are available in &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ryan-l-robinson/vscode-university-colour-palettes&quot;&gt;my GitHub&lt;/a&gt;. I&#39;d be happy for anybody who wants to include their own university to submit it as a merge request. I&#39;d also be happy if anybody wants to turn that into a VS Code extension.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Drupal Dev Environment Updated: The DevContainer</title>
    <link href="https://tech.ryanrobinson.ca/posts/2024/dev-env-updated-devcontainer/" />
    <updated>2024-04-08T15:46:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://tech.ryanrobinson.ca/posts/2024/dev-env-updated-devcontainer/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This continues from &lt;a href=&quot;https://tech.ryanrobinson.ca/posts/2024/dev-env-updated-dockerfiles/&quot;&gt;a previous post&lt;/a&gt; about a new Drupal dev environment, a significant upgrade from some previous posts that you can find on &lt;a href=&quot;https://tech.ryanrobinson.ca/tags/drupal-docker/&quot;&gt;the Drupal Docker tag&lt;/a&gt;. That covered the Dockerfiles, while this will cover changes to the Devcontainer.json and the postCreateCommand script. &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ryan-l-robinson/Drupal-Devcontainer&quot;&gt;The whole project&#39;s code can be found on my GitHub&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;devcontainer&quot;&gt;Devcontainer&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What changed in devcontainer from the previous setup? A few things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I reviewed several of the extensions and made some changes. The most significant are adding Playwright testing (maybe I&#39;ll be able to write more about that later), the PHP tools extension, and the Drupal extension. Between them I now have much stronger error detection, deprecation warnings, testing, and formatting to meet the Drupal standards. Some more notes about useful extensions are in &lt;a href=&quot;https://tech.ryanrobinson.ca/websites/vs-code/extensions-2024/&quot;&gt;my recent post about what extensions I use&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The postAttachCommand has to set the permissions again with each new time attaching to it, so the files that are set up as volumes don&#39;t revert to root.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;postcreatecommand&quot;&gt;postCreateCommand&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is mostly the same, at least for now: it installs all composer packages and sets up the database on the first time creating these images. A few things were able to be removed to simplify this script, functions like creating the database that are handled more easily in other ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What it still does:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Installs composer packages.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Puts the Drupal settings and local services files in place. This comes after the composer install so that the basic Drupal file structure is there already.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Import the site&#39;s configuration using drush.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set the admin password.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rebuild the node access cache. There aren&#39;t any nodes yet, but there is a warning on the site status for a bit if this function isn&#39;t included, so it&#39;s one extra command to save some confusion.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sets the environment indicator theme.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Clears the site&#39;s caches to reflect all changes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;next-gitlab-github-ci-cd-updates&quot;&gt;Next: GitLab/GitHub CI/CD Updates&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m going to continue with this by now improving it a step farther: instead of building the images each time on local, have it build in GitHub or GitLab programmatically, and then saving it alongside the repository in those platforms&#39; respective container registries. Then when it is time to start a new local development environment, it only needs to pull the latest image, not build it again. That saves time, especially if you have to switch between branches and especially if you have multiple team members who would otherwise all be spending time building it individually. This will include moving most of the postCreateCommand functionality into the GitLab CI / GitHub Actions, for both the web and database containers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I already have this working in my real context using GitLab. I have less experience with GitHub Actions but am working on doing the same idea there for a more shareable version.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Drupal Dev Environment Updated: The Dockerfiles</title>
    <link href="https://tech.ryanrobinson.ca/posts/2024/dev-env-updated-dockerfiles/" />
    <updated>2024-03-25T00:16:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://tech.ryanrobinson.ca/posts/2024/dev-env-updated-dockerfiles/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A while ago I wrote about building a &lt;a href=&quot;https://tech.ryanrobinson.ca/tags/drupal-docker/&quot;&gt;Docker Desktop dev environment for Drupal&lt;/a&gt;. It was built on Oracle Linux, a requirement in that context, with three images for Apache, PHP, and MySQL. But there were some significant problems with it, first and foremost that it was very slow. So, this is another version, now based on one of the official Drupal images instead of the Oracle Linux ones. &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ryan-l-robinson/Drupal-Devcontainer&quot;&gt;It can be seen on my GitHub&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-web-image&quot;&gt;The Web Image&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This new setup has both Apache and PHP in the same container, is about 40% of the total image size compared to the previous one, and runs much faster, probably because Apache and PHP are in the same container instead of having to communicate across the network. Let&#39;s start with the basic start to the image and its shell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-Dockerfile&quot; tabindex=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-Dockerfile&quot;&gt;FROM drupal:php8.2-apache
USER root
SHELL [&quot;/bin/bash&quot;, &quot;-c&quot;]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Install the extra useful packages - some of the most essential ones are already included in the Drupal image - and PHP development settings. The file copied from the PHP folder covers some of the XDebug configuration settings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-Dockerfile&quot; tabindex=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-Dockerfile&quot;&gt;# Install needed repositories and general packages, and put the php.ini in place
RUN apt-get update -y &#92;
    &amp;&amp; apt-get install -y wget git zip which sudo vim locales default-mysql-client docker nodejs npm &#92;
    &amp;&amp; apt-get upgrade -y &#92;
    &amp;&amp; mv /usr/local/etc/php/php.ini-development /usr/local/etc/php/php.ini

# Install PHP extensions, using PECL
RUN pecl channel-update pecl.php.net &#92;
    &amp;&amp; pecl install apcu xdebug uploadprogress &#92;
    &amp;&amp; docker-php-ext-enable apcu &#92;
    &amp;&amp; echo &quot;apc.enable_cli=1&quot; &gt;&gt; /usr/local/etc/php/conf.d/docker-php-ext-apcu.ini &#92;
    &amp;&amp; docker-php-ext-enable xdebug &#92;
    &amp;&amp; touch /var/log/xdebug.log &#92;
    &amp;&amp; chown www-data:www-data /var/log/xdebug.log &#92;
    &amp;&amp; docker-php-ext-enable uploadprogress
COPY /php /usr/local/etc/php/conf.d&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let the default www-data user have sudo permission without passwords, which would not be the way to go in production but in a development environment is pretty useful in case you ever need to do things like install a new package without rebuilding the whole environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-Dockerfile&quot; tabindex=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-Dockerfile&quot;&gt;# Add www-data user to sudo group, and allow those users to sudo without password
RUN usermod -a -G sudo www-data &#92;
    &amp;&amp; usermod -d /user/www-data www-data &#92;
    &amp;&amp; mkdir -p /user/www-data/.vscode-server &#92;
    &amp;&amp; chown -R www-data:www-data /user/www-data &#92;
    &amp;&amp; mkdir -p /user/www-data/.ssh &#92;
    &amp;&amp; chown -R www-data:www-data /user/www-data/.ssh &#92;
    &amp;&amp; chmod 700 -R /user/www-data/.ssh &#92;
    &amp;&amp; ssh-keyscan -t rsa gitlab.com &gt;&gt; /user/www-data/.ssh/known_hosts &#92;
    &amp;&amp; sed -i &quot;s/%sudo	ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL/%sudo	ALL=(ALL)	NOPASSWD: ALL/g&quot; /etc/sudoers&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fix a locale error that shows up once Apache is running, by specifying the locale it is running in. In my case, that&#39;s Canada, with Canadian English.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-Dockerfile&quot; tabindex=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-Dockerfile&quot;&gt;# Fixes locale errors, must happen before Apache. This is using my locale of Canada
RUN echo &quot;LC_ALL=en_CA.UTF-8&quot; &gt;&gt; /etc/environment &#92;
    &amp;&amp; echo &quot;en_CA.UTF-8 UTF-8&quot; &gt;&gt; /etc/locale.gen &#92;
    &amp;&amp; echo &quot;LANG=en_CA.UTF-8&quot; &gt; /etc/locale.conf &#92;
    &amp;&amp; locale-gen en_CA.UTF-8&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Add a self-signed certificate for the Apache configuration, so that we&#39;ll be able to browse the site locally with HTTPS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-Dockerfile&quot; tabindex=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-Dockerfile&quot;&gt;# Apache configuration, including SSL certificates and logs
COPY /apache /etc/apache2
RUN a2enmod ssl &#92;
    &amp;&amp; mkdir -p /etc/apache2/certs &#92;
    &amp;&amp; openssl req -batch -newkey rsa:4096 -nodes -sha256 -keyout /etc/apache2/certs/example.com.key -x509 -days 3650 -out /etc/apache2/certs/example.com.crt -config /etc/apache2/certs/openssl-config.txt &#92;
    &amp;&amp; chown -R root:www-data /etc/apache2 &#92;
    &amp;&amp; chmod 770 -R /etc/apache2/certs&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Increase some of the default resource limits for PHP. The defaults never seem to be nearly enough for Drupal. These go much larger, larger than you really need on production, but on local development it is easier to be safe than sorry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-Dockerfile&quot; tabindex=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-Dockerfile&quot;&gt;# Increase resources for PHP
RUN sed -i &quot;s/max_execution_time = 30/max_execution_time = 300/g&quot; /usr/local/etc/php/php.ini &#92;
    &amp;&amp; sed -i &quot;s/max_input_time = 60/max_input_time = 600/g&quot; /usr/local/etc/php/php.ini &#92;
    &amp;&amp; sed -i &quot;s/memory_limit = 128M/memory_limit = 2048M/g&quot; /usr/local/etc/php/php.ini &#92;
    &amp;&amp; sed -i &quot;s/upload_max_filesize = 2M/upload_max_filesize = 128M/g&quot; /usr/local/etc/php/php.ini &#92;
    &amp;&amp; sed -i &quot;s/post_max_size = 8M/post_max_size = 256M/g&quot; /usr/local/etc/php/php.ini &#92;
    &amp;&amp; sed -i &quot;s/;max_input_vars = 1000/max_input_vars = 10000/g&quot; /usr/local/etc/php/php.ini&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a minor thing, but I like when I grep through code to see results with the colour highlights, making it much easier to read. That can be done by setting an environment variable and putting an alias for grep into a bashrc file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-Dockerfile&quot; tabindex=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-Dockerfile&quot;&gt;# Set up nicer grep results
ENV GREP_COLORS=&#39;mt=1;37;41&#39;
COPY .bashrc /user/www-data/.bashrc&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Line up the script that will be run after creating the images. That script will handle setting up the Drupal database, but I&#39;ll cover that more in the next post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-Dockerfile&quot; tabindex=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-Dockerfile&quot;&gt;# Scripts for further actions to take on creation and attachment
COPY ./scripts/postCreateCommand.sh /postCreateCommand.sh&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Copy the Drupal settings file and the local services file. The former is the essential settings for any Drupal site, including being able to connect to the database. The latter is not essential but enables some of the development features that are ideal in local development, like seeing comments in the generated HTML code that shows you what template is being used to generate it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-Dockerfile&quot; tabindex=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-Dockerfile&quot;&gt;# Drupal configuration
COPY /drupal /web/sites&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, set the permissions on the main Drupal folder as well as on the script that we&#39;ll need to be able to run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-Dockerfile&quot; tabindex=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-Dockerfile&quot;&gt;RUN chown -R www-data:www-data /opt/drupal &#92;
    &amp;&amp; chown www-data:www-data /postCreateCommand.sh &#92;
    &amp;&amp; chmod 777 /postCreateCommand.sh&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much of this is the same as the previous version: adding a self-signed SSL certificate, increasing PHP resources. But a few things changed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Many of the PHP extensions are already installed from the Drupal image so I didn&#39;t need to do them again in this Dockerfile.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It needs a lot more overriding the permissions since that Drupal image already comes with a Drupal install in that /opt/drupal directory and with the www-data user, and with some as volumes which mean they immediately revert to root ownership when you attach to it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-database-image&quot;&gt;The Database Image&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&#39;s the entire Dockerfile:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-Dockerfile&quot; tabindex=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-Dockerfile&quot;&gt;# Use the default MariaDB image
FROM mariadb:latest

ENV MARIADB_ROOT_PASSWORD=drupalroot
ENV MARIADB_DATABASE=drupal
ENV MARIADB_USER=drupal
ENV MARIADB_PASSWORD=drupal

# Expose the MySQL port to be accessible to the web container.
EXPOSE 3306&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is essentially no change from the previous one, just setting the environment variables to define the database and its access.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;docker-compose&quot;&gt;Docker Compose&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The docker compose file is not doing anything too unusual. The main thing of note is the volumes. I do not have the entire /opt/drupal set up as volumes. That&#39;s because when you attach to it, the entire area would get its permissions reassigned back to root, which causes issues. It&#39;s also not very efficient, since I really don&#39;t need things like the core files and contributed modules in the vendor folder to be persistent. So instead, it defines the pieces that are relevant to be able to build it, as well as the private and public folders where I might want to download a file for testing that the site can use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also have it set up to share my user profile&#39;s SSH keys and preferred settings like the my commit name, so that I can connect to the repository without having to configure it all again with every new build.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-yml&quot; tabindex=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-yml&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;version&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;3.9&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;services&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;next-post&quot;&gt;Next Post&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the next post, I&#39;ll mention some of the changes to the devcontainer.json file and to the postCreateCommand script, although there&#39;s nothing too drastic there.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>IDRC Presentation on Open Menu</title>
    <link href="https://tech.ryanrobinson.ca/posts/2024/idrc-presentation/" />
    <updated>2024-02-21T23:22:36Z</updated>
    <id>https://tech.ryanrobinson.ca/posts/2024/idrc-presentation/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I recently joined the Inclusive Design Research Centre to present along with a couple of colleagues how we designed an &amp;quot;open menu&amp;quot;, a header-focused main menu navigation that works much better for screen reader users and also provides some other benefits like a Ctrl+F find.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://fluidproject.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/fluid/pages/11513504/Community+workshops+and+design+crits&quot;&gt;The video is available on the IDRC wiki.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&#39;t have a transcription of the entire presentation, but here are some of my key notes from the perspective of the Drupal developer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-process&quot;&gt;The Process&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The co-design process loop often went something like: Ashley (accessibility consultant) described what worked and what didn&#39;t about her experience as a screen reader user, Mark (digital experiences librarian) made an HTML mockup of what we should try instead, and I figured out how to make Drupal do that in the best and most sustainable way. Repeat as necessary until we&#39;re all happy with the results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had to consider several issues, not only accessibility. For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Timeline: One bit of important context was the launch timeline. I had just been hired and I was learning my way around the old site at the same time I was beginning the new site. We had a deadline for the new site to launch, what was at the time expected to be the Drupal 7 end of life (it got extended again after that). These menu considerations came as part of this rebuild process. That meant there was some balancing between what is ideal and what can be done in time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Security: Failure to meet that timeline would have security implications if we didn&#39;t meet it. We could have launched the open menu after launching the new site, in order to hit the end of life deadlines, but it would have been awkward at best and required restructuring the main visual menu at worst.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Visuals: While not the main focus of this feature, there is visual design for sighted users to consider. We want it to still be attractive and easy to use for sighted users as long as it doesn&#39;t come at the cost of screen reader users.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maintainability: How do we ensure we keep this working and accurate? A major important point to me was that there needed to be one source of information that fed both the collapsed menu and the open menu. Otherwise, there&#39;s a high likelihood that at some point the two will get out of sync with each other, where somebody adds to or rearranges the collapsible menu without considering the open menu or vice versa. Sometimes an inaccurate accessibility feature is worse than no accessibility feature at all, because people wouldn&#39;t think to go try the less-ideal collapsible menu if they&#39;ve been assured they have all the same content.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open source models: What can be done in Drupal core, what in a contributed theme, what in a contributed module, what in custom code? If a module is close to what we need but not quite there, how do we navigate what we report and try to get the maintainer to change vs what we should rebuild ourselves?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;lessons&quot;&gt;Lessons&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was a fascinating project for me in ways much deeper than the technical details. So here&#39;s a few things that stood out to me:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Empathy vs checklist: The biggest lesson is that personal experiences of disabled people really matter. I&#39;d worked with accessibility before, but mostly at the level of a WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) checklist in a contract consultancy context where finishing the job under the budget was the main priority. This whole project was a great example of taking the time to get it truly right to real user experiences. Ashley explained that even though a standard Drupal menu passes the checklist, it can be really time-consuming for her. Hire someone if you can to fill that same role. It opened my eyes to a more emphathetic approach rather than a checklist approach. Maybe you can&#39;t hire somebody - most of us can&#39;t, and even our time with Ashley was limited - but at least take the time to sit and try to imagine what it would feel like to do this without sight, or without hearing, or without a mouse. Don&#39;t just hit the WAVE extension button in your browser and declare it done.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Multiple solutions: Sometimes there isn&#39;t one solution that is perfect for everybody. We tried to figure out a way to make a menu that was optimal for all users. But the reality is that the standard collapsed navigation is ideal, tuned over decades of web development, for most sighted users who can skim at a glance without it taking much cognitive load. So we took an additive approach instead, keeping both versions of the menu. In hindsight this isn&#39;t really that shocking - we do the same for things like having a video and a transcript - but I hadn&#39;t really thought about it for something as central as the main navigation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jargon: Getting the descriptions for each page was more challenging than expected and one of the reasons why were questions about jargon. Often in talking about accessibility, we talk about wanting the most generic phrasing that everybody understands, avoiding jargon. That&#39;s great for new users not familiar with the jargon. But there is a tradeoff for those who are familiar with it: that&#39;s probably what they&#39;re looking for. If they&#39;re looking for the jargon and it isn&#39;t in the description, it doesn&#39;t show up from a site search or in the open menu items page where a Ctrl+F might find it. Some of that could be mitigated by including the jargon and the broader definition, but that has &lt;a href=&quot;https://tech.ryanrobinson.ca/websites/accessibility-descriptive/&quot;&gt;a tradeoff of making the content longer to sift through, which is especially more time consuming on a screen reader&lt;/a&gt;. Making it more accessible to one group can make it less accessible for others.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;coming-soon&quot;&gt;Coming Soon&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have another post coming about how this was technically achieved, which was relatively straightforward. The bigger lessons were here, in the process, but I do want to share how it was done for those that are interested in replicating it.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Drupal: Open Menu</title>
    <link href="https://tech.ryanrobinson.ca/posts/2024/open_menu/open-menu/" />
    <updated>2024-02-21T22:44:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://tech.ryanrobinson.ca/posts/2024/open_menu/open-menu/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://tech.ryanrobinson.ca/posts/2024/idrc-presentation/&quot;&gt;In a previous related post, I wrote about some lessons in a co-design project of an open menu, with a video where we presented about it to the IDRC&lt;/a&gt;. That was mostly about the process and this is about the result: a header navigation page on a Drupal 9 site. The goal was to provide an overview of the same information that’s in the main navigation, but in a more accessible way for screen readers and with descriptions that provide more information about the page without having to load the page. It was not a complete index of every page on the site; it was only an alternate format for the menu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As mentioned in that previous post, an important requirement is that it must update programmatically; we cannot leave it as a separate manually-updated page, because realistically it would only be a matter of time before somebody updated the menu but not the header navigation page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ryan-l-robinson/Drupal-open-menu&quot;&gt;a GitPod demo version of my solution on my GitHub&lt;/a&gt;. That’s only the relevant customizations, not a full functioning site, and you&#39;d need to add a couple of menu items to really see it in action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&#39;s an example screenshot of the open menu structure:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://tech.ryanrobinson.ca/posts/2024/open_menu/open-menu/lRNJlLJJy_-941.avif 941w&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://tech.ryanrobinson.ca/posts/2024/open_menu/open-menu/lRNJlLJJy_-941.webp 941w&quot;&gt;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; src=&quot;https://tech.ryanrobinson.ca/posts/2024/open_menu/open-menu/lRNJlLJJy_-941.png&quot; alt=&quot;&amp;quot;Open Menu page. After an introductory description, there is a sample page at the top level that is an h2 and a sample page below that at an h3.&amp;quot;&quot; width=&quot;941&quot; height=&quot;590&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;menu-entity-index&quot;&gt;Menu Entity Index&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re familiar with Drupal, you likely read the introduction and immediately thought of views. Views are the perfect solution whenever you are looking at a scenario involving one data source displayed in multiple ways. Drupal 9 does not expose everything I needed to views on its own, but there is a module that fills in the gap: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.drupal.org/project/menu_entity_index&quot;&gt;Menu Entity Index&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once that is installed, you’ll need to configure it. I did not find the settings page intuitive at all, but the first block of settings is which menus need to be indexed and the second block is which types of target to index. In my case, I only want to index content in the main navigation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://tech.ryanrobinson.ca/posts/2024/open_menu/open-menu/b-lZNiuVuQ-434.avif 434w&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://tech.ryanrobinson.ca/posts/2024/open_menu/open-menu/b-lZNiuVuQ-434.webp 434w&quot;&gt;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; src=&quot;https://tech.ryanrobinson.ca/posts/2024/open_menu/open-menu/b-lZNiuVuQ-434.png&quot; alt=&quot;&amp;quot;Settings for menu entity index. The first block is tracked menus and the second is tracked entity types.&amp;quot;&quot; width=&quot;434&quot; height=&quot;619&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notably, it cannot index views pages, so for this scheme to work, you can’t use views pages in the menu. Fortunately you can still make a views block, put that on a page, and put that page in the menu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;configure-the-view&quot;&gt;Configure the View&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The configuration for the view itself won&#39;t be too much of a surprise for anybody who has configured views before. It has a grouped block for each second-level menu, where the header had a programmatically-set ID so that they can be used for links (both from that top block and from the top level of the main menu itself). There&#39;s a lot of mundane configuration here so I won&#39;t break it all down, but &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ryan-l-robinson/Drupal-open-menu/blob/main/sync/config/views.view.open_menu.yml&quot;&gt;here&#39;s the configuration file&lt;/a&gt; if you want to import to your site, or you can check it out using the GitPod demo and going to Structure -&amp;gt; Views -&amp;gt; Open Menu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;overriding-the-view-template&quot;&gt;Overriding the View Template&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still had one more problem. The view involved used the grouping function to bunch together the results. I wanted the group label to be an h2 and have an id on it, so I did that using the rewrite the results functions. That worked with no issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I noticed it was also supplying an empty h3 immediately before my h2. That doesn’t hurt sighted users, but it does complicate the experience for screen reader users. It took some time to realize the h3 was coming from a template file in the views core module: views-view-unformatted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once I knew the source of the original file, I could edit it directly, but that would be lost as soon as there was an update to the theme. The more permanent answer is a subtheme with an override of that file. That seems a little excessive in the case of this demo, but in a real site you&#39;ll probably want a custom subtheme for all your CSS and templates anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ryan-l-robinson/Drupal-open-menu/blob/main/web/themes/custom/demo/templates/views/views-view-unformatted.html.twig&quot;&gt;That file is also in the GitHub&lt;/a&gt;, but it was a pretty tiny change removing the h3 wrapper from the grouping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;caveats&quot;&gt;Caveats&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a few caveats to this system:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There&#39;s no handling for menu items more than 2 levels deep. That may well be possible, but we didn&#39;t need it, so I haven&#39;t included it in this demo.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No views pages in the menu will show up in the open menu. But view blocks inserted into a page, where the page is in the menu, will show up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be very careful changing the module settings. Perhaps this is fixed two years later, but at the time, attempting to index certain entity types would result in a white screen of death on the next cron run. We&#39;ve never had problems with indexing content.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You could add some built-in warnings to the admin interface, or even override admin forms, to try to suppress the possibility of those caveats causing a problem, but this blog post was long enough so I&#39;ll leave it here.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Dark Content Mode</title>
    <link href="https://tech.ryanrobinson.ca/posts/2024/dark-content-mode/" />
    <updated>2024-02-21T21:46:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://tech.ryanrobinson.ca/posts/2024/dark-content-mode/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In case you haven&#39;t caught it yet, there&#39;s new functionality coming to browsers for dark mode applied to content. This could come as a surprise to web developers who did not plan for dark mode in their design, but is overall a win for those of us who prefer dark mode on all the things all the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s already become my default on Android Edge, inheriting that I have my device in dark mode. I haven&#39;t found it to be default on any other browser (including desktop Edge). Chrome has it as an experiment features flag in chrome://flags, so I did most of my testing by enabling that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;issues-found&quot;&gt;Issues Found&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest problem I found in my main work site was with images that were previously assuming white backgrounds. I found the nicest solution to that was using an SVG instead of a PNG file, which the dark content mode adapted to invert the colours quite nicely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were also some insufficient contrast I discovered, like grey borders around form text boxes, that were maybe a little weak in light mode but were barely visible in dark mode. Many of these were quickly solvable by making it a stronger contrast. For example, instead of a grey border against the white background, I made it into a black border. It content dark mode, it would flip to a white border on black background. Both modes came out looking better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I identified a few other contrast elements that were not quite ideal. But attempting a similar approach did not work. There were a few variations where I had black against the default light theme and trying it with the dark content mode turned it into a grey instead of a white - far from invisible, but not as strong of a contrast as I wanted. This is a new feature, not enabled by default other than that Android Edge that few people use, so I&#39;m hoping this gets cleaned up on the browser end and there isn&#39;t much else I need to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;no-way-to-target&quot;&gt;No Way to Target?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tried the media query for &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/prefers-color-scheme&quot;&gt;prefers-color-scheme&lt;/a&gt; but it doesn&#39;t help for this. That detects if the device prefers dark mode, not if the browser&#39;s dark content mode is on. It&#39;s nice if you want to specifically define what everything should look like in dark vs light modes. But as far as I could find, there&#39;s no way to specifically target content dark mode at this time.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>VS Code Extensions: My Workflows</title>
    <link href="https://tech.ryanrobinson.ca/posts/2024/vs-code-extensions-workflows/" />

    <id>https://tech.ryanrobinson.ca/posts/2024/vs-code-extensions-workflows/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;When it comes to my VS Code extensions, I have mine set up a few different ways depending on what kind of project I&#39;m working on:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;default&quot;&gt;Default&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are the default plugins I have locally installed, for every profile and every project container.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eamodio.gitlens&quot;&gt;GitLens&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-playwright.playwright&quot;&gt;Playwright Tests for VS code&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode&quot;&gt;Prettier&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Gruntfuggly.todo-tree&quot;&gt;Todo Tree&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bmuskalla.vscode-tldr&quot;&gt;tl;dr pages&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscode-icons-team.vscode-icons&quot;&gt;vscode-icons&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;static-sites&quot;&gt;Static Sites&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are additional plugins which come in handy with building static sites like this one and ryanrobinson.ca:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=yzhang.markdown-all-in-one&quot;&gt;Markdown All in One&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=DavidAnson.vscode-markdownlint&quot;&gt;Markdown lint&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eliostruyf.vscode-front-matter&quot;&gt;Front Matter CMS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;containers-remote-wordpress-drupal&quot;&gt;Containers/Remote (WordPress/Drupal)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This profile includes the basic requirements to connect to containers and/or remote:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers&quot;&gt;Dev Containers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-ssh&quot;&gt;Remote SSH&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each container, using the devcontainer.json functionality, can also define new extensions for that container. So here&#39;s an example of doing that for a Drupal site:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=cweijan.vscode-mysql-client2&quot;&gt;MySQL&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Stanislav.vscode-drupal&quot;&gt;Drupal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=whatwedo.twig&quot;&gt;Twig&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=DEVSENSE.phptools-vscode&quot;&gt;PHPTools&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>Text Underline Position</title>
    <link href="https://tech.ryanrobinson.ca/posts/2024/text-position-underline/" />
    <updated>2024-02-21T15:22:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://tech.ryanrobinson.ca/posts/2024/text-position-underline/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This one is a quick accessibility CSS tip. I have long been a proponent of the old standard of underlining links, and never underlining anything else. It helps make it clear that it is a link. Add a hover and focus effect to make it more obvious when they are selecting it, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it can introduce a problem: for certain reading disabilities, the line being close up against the text can make it hard to read. Even for myself without one of those disabilities, once it was flagged for me I immediately saw it every time I looked at a link.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here&#39;s a quick CSS solution that significantly helps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use &lt;code&gt;text-underline-position: under&lt;/code&gt; to make links with underlines easier to read. It moves the underline down to the bottom of the hanging letters (g, y, j) rather than right up tight against the bottom of other letters and cutting right through the middle of the hanging letters. It may not quite be perfect - even better might be a few pixels below the hanging letters to get space there as well - but it solves the majority of the problem with one quick CSS change.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Church Website Content</title>
    <link href="https://tech.ryanrobinson.ca/posts/2023/church-site-content/" />
    <updated>2023-08-07T18:46:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://tech.ryanrobinson.ca/posts/2023/church-site-content/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This is not my usual type of content for this site, but I was reminded of it from a Mastodon conversation and wanted to put it somewhere more or less permanent. Before building the latest iteration of my church&#39;s website several years ago, I put out the question on Twitter for what information people want before they would consider visiting. I sent those to the church leadership and still had the document, so I looked it up to summarize those questions again below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;sunday-worship&quot;&gt;Sunday Worship&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When does the service begin and end?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is there a nursery for infants and toddlers? Something for children and youth?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are children welcome in the service, even if they make noise?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is there adult education?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What&#39;s the (usually unspoken) dress code?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is there parking? Bike racks? Transit nearby?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where&#39;s the main entrance?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is there coffee available?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;inclusivity&quot;&gt;Inclusivity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is the building accessible with a wheelchair?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is there assistance for those with hearing impairments?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(You could add more specific disabilities)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are women or non-binary people involved in leadership? Could they be a pastor?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you have a gender neutral washroom?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Could an LGBTQ+ person be your pastor?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Would your pastor marry a same-sex couple?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How well does the racial demographics of the church match the wider community?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;other-ministries&quot;&gt;Other Ministries&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is there a youth group? What do they do? How often do they meet? What&#39;s your understanding of youth discipleship?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What areas of social justice and community work do you do?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What social groups can I join?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What about Prayer groups? Or Bible study groups?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;rental-of-facilities&quot;&gt;Rental of Facilities&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can I use the space for weddings or concerts?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do I have to be a member?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How many does it seat?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does it cost? Is there any discount (or free) for indigenous groups whose land you are on?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;theology&quot;&gt;Theology&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most did not want a full statement of faith on every possible question, but they wanted to know key values of the community that shape how the church tackles all those other questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are you starting from the love of God or from an inerrant Bible or something else?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is there a denominational affiliation?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;other&quot;&gt;Other&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can I donate online?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do I contact someone and who do I contact for what needs?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can I see a calendar of upcoming events?&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Drupal: Add Role Based on File</title>

    <title>Future of Microblogging Social Media</title>
    <link href="https://tech.ryanrobinson.ca/posts/2023/future-microblogging/" />
    <updated>2023-07-14T13:18:09Z</updated>
    <id>https://tech.ryanrobinson.ca/posts/2023/future-microblogging/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Twitter, Mastodon, Calckey, Bluesky, Threads... And a whole bunch more that aren&#39;t even worth mentioning in my opinion (&lt;a href=&quot;https://tech.ryanrobinson.ca/posts/2022/twitter-mastodon-coso/&quot;&gt;I did try a couple of them&lt;/a&gt;). It&#39;s an interesting time for social media, especially the microblogging format.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part of what makes it so interesting is that there are real differences in philosophies of what the Internet - and therefore, society at large - should be, not only a difference in which billionaire gets to sell all our data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, after a particularly tumultous week, I decided now is a good time to check in with how I feel about the current options and where I see things going from here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;twitter&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twitter is dying. It may not fully shut down, but there&#39;s no trust of anything you read, there&#39;s lots of harassment, you&#39;re limited in how much you can even use it, there&#39;s lots of security failures and privacy violations, occasionally it goes down for several hours. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/07/13/twitter-creators-payments-right-wing/&quot;&gt;They&#39;re even now bribing far right influencers to keep people around spewing hate speech&lt;/a&gt; so yeah, if you&#39;re still viewing Twitter, or still buying ads on Twitter, you&#39;re directly funding hate speech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s on life support and it&#39;s hard to see it lasting for much longer as anything more than Musk&#39;s vanity project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;threads&quot;&gt;Threads&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Threads from Meta is the other big corporate player, trying to claim that spot as the default microblogging platform. One big difference is that they want it to be more of a happy fun place that advertisers want to be with minimal moderation efforts required, so they&#39;re downplaying talk of real life issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have not personally used it. I don&#39;t use anything owned by Meta. From what I&#39;ve heard, it&#39;s a very rough start in terms of features, but as you expect from Meta&#39;s expertise, it&#39;s easy to get started and it got a huge start from brands, journalists, and influencers - the kinds that drive the network effect - in addition to everybody else. The feed is heavily algorithmic, forcefeeding you a lot of brand content instead of who you follow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where it gets really interesting is their promise that it will be federated with the ActivityPub protocol, meaning it will not be a complete walled garden. Why are they doing that is hard to say. Maybe they think it will appease regulators. Maybe some engineer who does believe in federation proposed it without really thinking it would be approved and it got through. In any event, it&#39;s great to see. I&#39;ll respond to more of that below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;bluesky&quot;&gt;Bluesky&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bluesky is the most interesting, somewhere in the middle of the spectrum. It&#39;s federated, sort of. They&#39;re promising their protocol will be available to others. But it isn&#39;t yet. And it&#39;s a unique protocol, not tying in to ActivityPub, the established standard. Which means is still exists on its own, like Twitter, at least until the protocol is done and they manage to sell others on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my time there, I&#39;ve struggled to see a unique selling proposition that can keep it going. It has some nice features: the options for content filters, being able to subscribe to someone else&#39;s mute list which can shut down problem accounts faster, making your username a domain you own, some degree of customizing your feeds. But as I learned back in the Google+ days, features alone do not a social network make, especially once the established players start copying the best ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The unique selling proposition so far seems to be that it is not as much of a cesspool as Twitter, not as confusing to sign up as Mastodon, and not controlled by an evil megacorp like Threads. That comes from the exclusivity of being invite only at this point: most of the people who are there are more or less on the same page with what they want from this network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the seams are showing with each time it fails to moderate well - they don&#39;t even have a trust and safety leadership structure - and as the user base steadily grows. As eventually happened with Facebook, exclusivity isn&#39;t much of a selling point when it will get more inclusive over time. Facebook survived because there wasn&#39;t much in the way of competition. But for Bluesky? There&#39;s plenty fighting for this space right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And more to the point, most of the people I see there I don&#39;t think really want exclusivity forever. A lot are socially conscious &amp;quot;shitposters&amp;quot; and journalists and authors. I was for a while referring to the first group mostly as activists, but I&#39;ve realized that isn&#39;t quite right. They&#39;re more like we saw a lot on Twitter, people who compete for the most snarky response to whatever the story of the day is that we&#39;re all angry about, then move on to the next thing tomorrow. That&#39;s not so much activism, which is usually more focused on long-term efforts toward a specific cause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in any case, wherever it falls in the activism work vs shitposting spectrum, it can only go so far in a closed bubble. Most of them are still on Twitter and/or on Threads as well for that reason. So how long do they want to spend also focusing efforts on Bluesky? Or do they keep it as their secondary place of rest, to recover from the more frontline work elsewhere?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I see that fading out as the exclusivity fades and the lack of trust and safety becomes more obvious, and I&#39;m not sure they&#39;ll have any other selling point to replace it. Bluesky seems to think the selling point is their protocol, but it&#39;s not even done yet and most people don&#39;t care about federation. Those who do are already in the fediverse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe I&#39;m wrong. Maybe they hire a big moderation team that sets the new gold standard for protecting marginalized people. That would certainly be a selling point. But they aren&#39;t doing that so far and that makes me think they don&#39;t have much of a future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-open-fediverse-mastodon-and-calckey&quot;&gt;The Open Fediverse: Mastodon and Calckey&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mastodon is where I have mostly found my home (@&lt;a href=&quot;mailto:Ryan@mstdn.ca&quot;&gt;Ryan@mstdn.ca&lt;/a&gt;). It&#39;s got years of stability in its extensive features - some would argue too many features that make it harder to use. It&#39;s on the ActivityPub protocol so it connects with other fediverse projects, including eventually Threads. The complaints are mostly that it is hard to use, especially signing up and having to pick a server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Calckey is another in the fediverse that addresses some of the concerns many have with Mastodon, like full text search and quote posts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are lots more that I won&#39;t get into: Pixelfed for photos (think Instagram), Bookwyrm for book reviews (think Goodreads), Lemmy or Kbin for forum-like conversations (Reddit)@. They can all talk to each other. That&#39;s a pretty promising future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;predicting-the-future&quot;&gt;Predicting the Future&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My guess of what happens is we end up like email. A few big corporate giants control most of the email: Google, Microsoft, etc. They offer the service for free in exchange for mining data and showing ads, or in some cases also with a subscription offer that doesn&#39;t show ads for a monthly fee (Microsoft 365 Home includes this). It&#39;s a quality service, with many professionals working on problems like spam prevention and security patching. That&#39;s likely to be Threads the way things are currently going.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it is possible to run your own email server that can send messages to and receive messages from the big ones or other small email servers. It&#39;s not easy. You&#39;ll have to meet some fairly high security standards and spam prevention. But you can. That&#39;s a lot of the smaller cases of people running their own Mastodon or other servers for a few dollars a month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or you can pay for a professional version of email, like Microsoft 365 Business. There&#39;s no ad scrapings, they&#39;ll take care of most of the security and maintenance, and you just need to pay a few dollars a month and configure it to your liking. That&#39;s a great option if you can afford it. In this comparison, that might be some of the bigger fediverse instances. Most of them operate on a donation basis. You don&#39;t have to support them financially, but somebody does have to or it won&#39;t keep going.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suspect that&#39;s where we get with microblogging, and I&#39;ll consider that a huge win. Threads may be the equivalent of Gmail, that many have. Most people will still opt for giving all their data to a billionaire for the right to look at ads, in exchange for all the ease of use that a company like Meta or Google can provide. But you will have some choice other than that and being a hermit, an option that has been increasingly tempting for me over the last 10 years. Maybe you host your own ActivityPub service. Maybe you pay somebody else. Maybe they implement ads but without the data mining. Maybe you stay on somebody else&#39;s without ever giving back or seeing ads. But I am happy that at least in this future there would be options.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Composer: Options for a Submodule</title>
    <link href="https://tech.ryanrobinson.ca/posts/2023/drupal-subprojects/" />
    <updated>2023-07-09T19:12:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://tech.ryanrobinson.ca/posts/2023/drupal-subprojects/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Suppose you want to tie in another private git package, such as something that is not listed on the Drupal directory - as part of your standard build process. Here are two approaches to do that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;composer&quot;&gt;Composer&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drupal packages are managed with a composer file. Composer files can pull from many sources. Most commonly in the case of a Drupal project, that means pulling in modules and themes from the Drupal directory. But it also includes the ability to pull in projects as zip files or a git project hosted elsewhere, even a private one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&#39;s how:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create the module that you want to pull in and give it a composer.json file. Here&#39;s an example of that file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-json&quot; tabindex=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-json&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;&quot;name&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;ryan-robinson/demo-module&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;&quot;type&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;drupal-module&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;&quot;description&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;Demo module&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;&quot;keywords&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;Drupal&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;module&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;&quot;license&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;GPL-2.0+&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;&quot;require&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;&quot;drupal/core&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;^9.0 || ^10&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;&quot;config&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;&quot;platform&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;&quot;php&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;8.1&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Add two things to the composer.json of your Drupal project:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One, you need to define the source for where to get the project:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-json&quot; tabindex=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-json&quot;&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;&quot;repositories&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;&quot;type&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;vcs&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;&quot;url&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;git@gitlab.com:ryan-robinson/demo-module.git&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;&quot;branch&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;main&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, you need to add it to the requirements list to pull in:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-json&quot; tabindex=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-json&quot;&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;&quot;require&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;&quot;ryan-robinson/demo-module&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;dev-main&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the repository is private, you&#39;ll also need an auth.json file with your personal access token. Here&#39;s an example that would work for a GitLab project:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-json&quot; tabindex=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-json&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;&quot;gitlab-token&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;&quot;gitlab.com&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;token value&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;git-submodule&quot;&gt;Git Submodule&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other approach is to make it a git submodule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The advantage of the submodule approach is if you want to be able to continue to contribute to that. You can work on the parent project and the submodule at the same time, committing them both separately. Of course that only matters I&#39;d you have permission to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The context I&#39;ve found myself using this: when I&#39;m developing a custom Drupal module, I need a Docker devcontainer environment to work within for testing. That&#39;s one git repository. I also need a repository for the module itself, so that it will be ready to share with other Drupal projects (often using the composer technique above). This allows me to load the devcontainer, work on the module, and commit back to the module.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This can be done by running the &lt;code&gt;git submodule add&lt;/code&gt; command, e.g.:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-bash&quot; tabindex=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;git&lt;/span&gt; submodule &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;add&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;URL to module&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This generates a .gitmodules file at the project root that looks something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[submodule &amp;quot;web/modules/custom/demo-module&amp;quot;]
	path = web/modules/custom/demo-module
	url = [URL to module]
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

    <title>Accessibility: Level of Descriptiveness</title>
    <link href="https://tech.ryanrobinson.ca/posts/2023/descriptive-alt/" />
    <updated>2023-06-11T18:46:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://tech.ryanrobinson.ca/posts/2023/descriptive-alt/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;There&#39;s a tension in discussing accessibility for screen reader users that comes up sometimes. Most recently and perhaps most commonly is about ALT text, but it can also apply to other things, too. The main conflict is between:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should provide lots of detail in order to make sure a blind user has access to as much detail as a sighted user can. If you&#39;ve got a picture of a cute cat, you provide all the details about the cat: colour, size, facial expression, posture in the shot, anything that a sighted user would be able to see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should provide only the core details so that the screen reader user can get to the important point as fast as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It might be tempting, especially if you&#39;re in the first camp, to frame this as something like equality vs efficiency. But it&#39;s really two different definitions of equality: is it equality in detail or equality in function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another way to think about it is in terms of cognitive processing time. When an image has more details, it doesn&#39;t really add to the time that a sighted user needs to process it all, unless it&#39;s a Where&#39;s Waldo kind of scenario that is intentionally hiding details in a way that is not available at a glance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, adding more text description that needs to be spoken out loud is a linear function. If you have twice as much descriptive content, that&#39;s twice as much time to listen to it. Maybe you structure it in such a way that they can get the basics out of the way and then have the longer description in a different spot that they can easily skip over, giving them a choice, but that&#39;s not always going to be easy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what&#39;s the answer? How much description should be added for screenreader users? Like many things in life, I think the answer is &amp;quot;it depends.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&#39;s one scenario: you&#39;re posting on Mastodon about how cute your cat is. In that kind of scenario, the point is the details. You probably should have a description of the cat and what makes it cute. If somebody is choosing to listen to the description of the image attached to a post about how cute your cat is, it&#39;s probably fair to assume that they want the details even if that takes a minute or two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A chart of data may vary on the context. In a quick casual social media post, it&#39;s probably better to get to the point. Imagine a chart that shows the increase of CO2 emissions over time, spanning several years with lots of data points, but the clear purpose of the chart is to show how badly things are increased. Somebody probably doesn&#39;t want to be scrolling social media and get bogged down in a 5 minute narration of data points naming every year plus exact numbers for that year that all blend together and are hard to interpret. That&#39;s probably not what they&#39;re there for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what if it&#39;s the same chart but as an academic resource? If somebody is doing research, they might need to know the exact data points, so the ALT text (or corresponding text nearby) needs to be quite detailed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Side note: I once heard about efforts to aid screen reader users encountering a graph to get the point better than a list of numbers, that relies on sounds. If the data is going up, it makes a higher pitch sound. If the data is going down, it makes a lower pitch sound. It will be interesting to see if something like that ever becomes standardized enough to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This exact same distinction can also apply to other context like menu items: do you want to add extensive aria-labels to force verbose experiences on blind users? The title attribute is a nice balance in that example. At least in Jaws, there is a user setting for whether to read out title text. This allows developers to empower the blind users to decide for themselves whether they want the verbose description or not. And it&#39;s always better to empower users to have control over their own experience whenever possible. Provide title attributes and if they want it, they&#39;ll have it; if they don&#39;t want it, it won&#39;t slow them down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case, the main point is that ALT text and accessibility in general is not always an obvious formula. Sometimes there are tensions to navigate. The most important part is that you are thinking about it, and when possible listening to the real experiences of users to steadily improve how to navigate those tensions.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Drupal: OpenAI Module</title>
    <link href="https://tech.ryanrobinson.ca/posts/2023/drupal-openai/" />
    <updated>2023-05-03T23:46:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://tech.ryanrobinson.ca/posts/2023/drupal-openai/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;AI, or more specifically large language models (LMMs) are all the rage these days, so it shouldn&#39;t come as too much of a surprise that there is now &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.drupal.org/project/openai&quot;&gt;a Drupal module that integrates OpenAI&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is only an alpha release but includes several submodules to leverage OpenAI tools within a Drupal site in various ways:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Generate content for you in any content type&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Speech to text&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Interaction with the ChatGPT prompt endpoint&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A button in CKEditor to send a prompt to OpenAI and get text back&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Assistance in the content editing process, such as adjusting your tone and summarizing body text&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Analyzes logs to summarize likely problems&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven&#39;t given it a try yet, mainly because I do not have a paid OpenAI API key and I assume I cannot use this without one, but it definitely could be worthwhile in certain Drupal site contexts.&lt;/p&gt;
